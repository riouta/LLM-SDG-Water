Trends in the water cycle and some of the most important hydrological \\nevents of 2024 are interpreted and discussed. \\nGlobal summary \\nKey aspects of the water cycle in 2024 over the global land area were: \\n• Precipitation over land was close to the 1995–2005 average. Extremely dry months have become increasingly \\ncommon in recent decades, with 38% more record-dry months in 2024 than for the baseline period. \\n• Daily precipitation extremes were 52% more common in 2024 than during 1995–2005, with record-breaking \\ndaily rainfall events in West Africa, Europe and Asia. There has been a significant increasing trend of 4% per \\ndecade over land. \\n• Average temperature over land was the highest recorded globally and in 111 countries, and globally 1.2°C \\nabove the 1995–2005 average. The frequency of record-warm months was the highest since 1979. \\n• High temperature: new records were set for annual maximum temperature in 34 countries and hot days in 40 \\ncountries. Both show increasing trends. \\n• Low temperatures: globally, the number of frost days over land was the lowest on record. Annual minimum \\ntemperatures are increasing, especially in the tropics. \\n• Relative air humidity over land was the highest since 2018, but a declining trend remains. Humidity was very \\nlow in South America and Central Africa in 2024. \\n• Soil water showed strong regional contrasts, with extreme dryness in South America and Southern Africa and \\nwet conditions in West Africa. \\n• Vegetation condition was the highest since 2001, continuing a steady increase. Drought impacts on vegetation \\nwere strongest in the Amazon region and Southern Africa. \\n• Surface water extent over land was close to average. There has been an increasing trend in record-high \\nmonthly water extent globally of 3% per decade since 2003. \\n• River flows were very low in northern South America and high in Western, Central and Eastern Africa. There \\nhas been an increasing trend in record-high flows of 21% per decade since 2001. \\n• Lake and reservoir water storage worldwide declined for the fifth year in a row, with unprecedented lows in \\nSouth America and record-high levels in Africa.'),\n",

In more recent decades, the use of \\nsatellites to observe water at and below the Earth’s \\nsurface has developed into practical solutions. Ideally, \\nsatellite measurements are calibrated to on-ground \\nmeasurements where they exist to increase their \\naccuracy. Once calibrated, they can provide \\ninformation much faster, over much larger areas and \\nwith much greater detail than the on-ground \\nmeasurement network alone.  \\nAll data discussed in this report were developed using \\nmethods that have been published: \\nPrecipitation and weather data are estimated by \\ncombining the latest satellite observations with all \\nglobally available weather station data and information \\nfrom weather forecasting models1 \\nSoil water is interpreted from measurements by \\npassive and active (radar) satellite microwave \\ninstruments and made available by the EU Copernicus \\nClimate Data Store2 \\nSurface water occurrence, including lakes, rivers and \\nother forms of (temporary) inundation, was mapped \\nusing NASA’s MODIS satellite imagery3. \\nRiver flows are estimated by automated measurement \\nof river width in satellite imagery4  \\nLake and reservoir volume is estimated by combining \\nsatellite measurements of surface water level and \\nextent with topography5. \\n \\n1 Beck et al., Bulletin American Meteorological Society , 2019 (link) and \\n2022 (link) \\n2 Copernicus Climate Data Store (link, v202012 combined product) \\n3 NASA and USGS Earth Data (link) \\nVegetation condition (NDVI) responds to water \\navailability and is observed by NASA’s MODIS \\nsatellites3.  \\nTerrestrial water storage, including groundwater, soil \\nwater, surface water, snow and land ice, is derived from \\ngravity measurements by the GRACE Follow-On \\nsatellites6. Missing data were imputed using a deep-\\nlearning approach7 \\nThe key objective of the Global Water Monitor is to \\nmake up-to-date, global and accurate climate and \\nwater information freely available and easily \\naccessible. We developed a visual data explorer, the \\nGlobal Water Monitor (www.globalwater.online). All \\ndata shown in this report are directly derived from that \\nwebsite and, therefore, can be reproduced or examined \\nin more detail. Users can retrieve and visualise maps or \\ntime series for any location, administrative \\nhydrological region or hand-drawn area.

For example, rainfall in a particular period \\n(e.g., March to September) may be 100 mm more than \\nthe average for the same period in all previous years. \\nPercentage of the mean puts the same information in a \\nrelative context. For example, the same 100 mm \\ndifference would be 110% of (or 10% above) a longer-\\nterm average value of 1000 mm. \\nStandardised anomaly or σ (sigma) value is a useful \\nmeans to compare the actual conditions to previous \\nyears in a way that accounts for the year-to-year \\nvariation experienced historically. It is calculated by \\ndividing the actual anomaly by the standard deviation \\nof values in previous years. Below is a general \\ninterpretation of the colour scale used in most maps in \\nthis report. Extremely high or low values often coincide \\nwith record values in the time series, but that is not \\nautomatically the case. \\n \\nColour legend and interpretation of standard anomalies. Note that \\ncolours are reversed for air temperature to be more intuitive. For \\nreference, this figure is also provided in the back of the report (p. 57).  \\nSummaries were calculated by country as defined by \\nthe International Organisation for Standardization (ISO \\n3166-1) and include the 193 UN member countries as \\nwell as other administrative entities. In the Global \\nWater Monitor, summary data are also available for \\nsubnational regions (e.g., states and provinces). No \\npolitical statement is intended by use of the ISO and \\nUN lists. \\nMany river basins cover more than one country and \\nconversely, large countries may contain multiple river \\nbasins. Therefore, summaries were also calculated by \\nriver basin. In the case of islands and coastal regions \\nwith multiple small catchments, river ‘basins’ can be a \\nseries of bordering catchments. In the Global Water \\nMonitor, summary data are also available for individual \\nsmaller catchments within basins.  \\nIf there are no gaps in the data, averages across \\ncountries or catchments can be calculated directly. If \\nthere are some missing data, they can be estimated. \\nHowever, if most data are missing, calculated averages \\ncan be misleading.  \\nSummarising storage in lakes by country or basin is \\nstraightforward in principle, as they can be added up. \\nHowever, not all water bodies are measured all the \\ntime, and gaps in the data need to be estimated.  \\nSummarising river flows by country or catchment is \\nchallenging. For example, many countries contain \\nmultiple rivers. We selected the fifteen river \\nobservation locations with the largest long-term \\naverage flows within the country or catchment and \\ncalculated a weighted average value. By its very nature, \\naveraging over years and regions can hide locally \\nsevere conditions or extreme events that occur over \\nshort periods. This should be kept in mind when \\ninterpreting the information. \\nSatellite instruments can provide a near-immediate \\nglobal overview of climate and water conditions, but \\nthey have uncertainties. Where available, onsite \\nobservations are usually more accurate and necessary \\nto calibrate remote sensing approaches like those used \\nhere. Protecting and expanding the remaining water \\nmeasurement station network should be a priority.  \\nRecord length, frequency and spatial detail vary \\nbetween data sources. For example, climate data are \\navailable from 1979, water body data from 1984, soil \\nwater data from 1991, river flow data from 2000, and \\nterrestrial water storage data from 2002 onwards.  \\nEven satellite observations are unavailable in some \\nregions and at some times. For example, soil water \\nobservations are only possible if the soil is not frozen \\nor covered with dense forest, and surface water and \\nvegetation observations require daylight and clear \\nskies. In the case of climate data, data gaps are filled \\nby weather models with uncertainties of their own.  \\nEfforts were made to confirm the interpretation of the \\ndata using background research, but the above \\nlimitations should be kept in mind when reading this \\nreport. Anyone inclined to take action based on the \\ninformation presented here should first consult the \\nrelevant local or national agencies.'),\n",

The\\nIWRM lens exposes gaps in institutional coordination, policy enforcement, and\\ninfrastructure investment that undermine equitable water distribution.

The issue is so pervasive that access to clean, safe water\\nhas become more of a luxury than a basic human right for many\\ncommunities (Plessis, 2021). South Africa ranks as one of the most\\nwater-scarce countries, with an average annual rainfall of only\\n464 mm/year, much lower than the global average of 860 mm/year\\n(Botai et al., 2016). The United Nations Sustainable Development\\nGoal 6, which emphasizes universal access to clean water and\\nsanitation, underscores the urgency of this issue, yet substantial\\ngaps remain, particularly in rural areas ( Hedden and\\nCilliers, 2014).\\nClimate change presents an additional complexity for water\\nmanagement in South Africa ( Apraku et al., 2023). Increasing\\ntemperatures, erratic rainfall patterns, and more frequent and\\nprolonged droughts threaten water availability, especially in rural\\nareas (Baudoin et al., 2017). According toVan Wilgen et al. (2016),\\nthe country has seen a temperature increase of about 1.5\\n°C since 196,\\nwith projections indicating that the temperature could rise by 4°Cb y\\n2100. As climate change affects weather patterns and the\\nhydrological cycle, rural South Africa faces a rising risk of water\\nscarcity, further complicating securing sufﬁcient clean water for its\\ncommunities (du Plessis, 2019). In 2019, the Department of Water\\nand Sanitation (DWS) reported that over 30% of the country’s water\\nresources are already under stress, with South Africa losing 20% of\\nits annual water supply due to pollution and mismanagement\\n(DWS, 2019).\\nClimate change is expected to exacerbate this challenge,\\nespecially in rural communities, where groundwater levels are\\nalready low, and droughts are increasingly frequent. In fact, the\\n2015–2016 drought led to signiﬁcant reductions in water levels\\nacross key dams, such as the Vaal Dam, which is the primary source\\nof water for the Gauteng region, dipping to just 26% of its capacity\\n(Figure 1)( Mathivha et al., 2024; Schreiner et al., 2018). Such events\\ndemonstrate the vulnerability of rural communities that depend\\nheavily on surface water for their water needs. Approximately 42%\\nof rural households in South Africa lack consistent access to clean\\nwater and rely on unsafe sources like rivers, dams, and unprotected\\nwells (Hedden and Cilliers, 2014). These communities face dire\\nconsequences from water contamination, which leads to waterborne\\ndiseases such as cholera, typhoid, and dysentery.\\nSouth Africa’s rural water scarcity is starkly evident in access\\ndisparities. The GeneralStatistics South Africa (2023)indicated that\\nwhile the national average for piped water access is high, only 15% of\\nrural households have piped water inside their homes, and 30% still\\nrely on unsafe or natural sources (unprotected wells, streams, dams,\\netc.) (seeFigure 2). Theseﬁgures vary signiﬁcantly by province, with\\nLimpopo and Eastern Cape facing acute challenges due to\\ngovernance failures and climate impacts Globally, similar patterns\\nemerge in India, where groundwater depletion limits access, and the\\nSahel, where funding shortages hinder decentralized systems (Jain\\net al., 2021 ; United Nations, 2020 ).

A key factor contributing to this is inadequate infrastructure\\n(Maake and Holtzhausen, 2015). Geographical factors pose another\\nchallenge to water access. Many rural regions, especially those in\\nremote or mountainous areas, face dif ﬁculties in building the\\ninfrastructure necessary to deliver clean water. According to a\\nreport by the Water Research Commission (WRC) (2022), the\\nlack of access to proper water infrastructure in rural areas results\\nin higher reliance on unreliable water sources. The Greater Giyani\\nMunicipality, for example, has experienced severe challenges in\\nproviding water due to the geographic spread and limited\\ntransport infrastructure ( Bazaanah and Mothapo, 2024 ).\\nAddressing these challenges requires not only investment in\\nwater infrastructure but also the integration of climate adaptation\\nmeasures, improved governance, and strong community\\nengagement (Mpongwana et al., 2022).\\nFinancial constraints also play a signiﬁcant role in hindering\\naccess to clean water in rural communities. According to a\\n2017 report by Statistics South Africa (2017) ,a p p r o x i m a t e l y\\n55.5% of South Africa ’s rural population lives in poverty,\\nmaking it difﬁcult for residents to afford private water systems\\nor sanitation solutions. Moreover, government funding for rural\\nw a t e rp r o j e c t si so f t e nl i m i t e d ,leaving communities with few\\nresources to address their water needs ( Mpongwana et al.,\\n2022). Although the South African government has allocated\\nfunds for rural water supply, these resources are often\\ninsufﬁcient to meet the growing demands. Consequently, rural\\ncommunities continue to face major obstacles in securing clean\\nwater, leaving many dependent on unsafe, untreated sources that\\nincrease their vulnerability to waterborne diseases. South Africa’s\\nw a t e rs c a r c i t ya l i g n sw i t hg l o b al challenges in water-stressed\\nregions. In India, groundwater depletion mirrors Limpopo ’s\\ndam declines, yet community-led watershed management\\nenhances resilience, offering SES lessons for South Africa (Jain\\net al., 2021). In the Sahel, decentralized water committees, akin to\\nSouth Africa’s Water User Associations, struggle with funding,\\nsuggesting shared climate ﬁnance strategies ( United Nations,\\n2020). While the Olabanji et al. (2021) and Baudoin et al.\\n(2017) project a 4\\n°C temperature rise by 2100, regional models\\nsuggest varied drought severity, necessitating adaptive\\ninfrastructure ( Ziervogel et al., 2014 ). Through SES-driven\\nrainwater harvesting, rural co mmunities cope with governance\\ngaps, yet lack formal support, underscoring the need for IWRM-\\nSES integration (Makaya et al., 2020).\\nSouth Africa’s water crisis cannot be fully understood without\\naccounting for the dual pressures of climate variability and\\ninstitutional fragmentation. The effects are particularly acute in\\nrural provinces such as Limpopo and the Eastern Cape, where\\ncommunities rely on vulnerable surface and groundwater systems.\\nFor example, the 2015–2016 drought reduced major dam levels to\\ncrisis thresholds, exposing both ecological and infrastructural\\nvulnerabilities. At the same time, governance de ﬁciencies have\\nintensiﬁed the crisis (Mathivha et al., 2024).

This combination provides a holistic lens to\\ninterrogate the structural and adaptive dimensions of water\\nscarcity in rural South Africa. It allows us to critically assess\\ninstitutional constraints, socio-political power dynamics,\\ncommunity coping mechanisms, and the potential of emerging\\ntechnologies in shaping water outcomes. The IWRM framework,\\nas endorsed by the Global Water Partnership (2000), promotes\\ncoordinated development and management of water, land, and\\nrelated resources to maximize social and economic welfare\\nequitably without compromising ecosystem sustainability\\n(Nkhata, 2020 ). In the South African context, IWRM is\\nembedded in the National Water Act of 1998, which emphasizes\\nequitable access, efﬁciency, and sustainability (van Koppen et al.,\\n2011). It also highlights the importance of balancing competing\\nwater demands for domestic use, agriculture, and ecological\\npreservation. Applied here, the IWRM lens allows us to examine:\\ni) Policy coherence between national and municipal levels.\\nii) Governance failures, including misaligned mandates,\\ncorruption, and poor interdepartmental coordination.\\niii) Infrastructure gaps that hinder equitable service delivery.\\niv) Regulatory enforcement and institutional accountability,\\nespecially in large-scale interventions like the Giyani Bulk\\nWater Project.\\nThe IWRM-SES framework’s novelty lies in its multi-scalar\\nintegration, unlike resilience theory’s focus on system recovery or\\nadaptive governance’s emphasis on institutionalﬂexibility. IWRM-\\nSES uniquely combines policy reform with community agency,\\naddressing both structural constraints and local dynamics. For\\ninstance, it explains why Giyani’s governance failures persist and\\nhow Muyexe ’s harvesting fosters resilience, posing analytical\\nquestions like: How do policy gaps exacerbate rural scarcity, and\\nwhat community strategies mitigate these? This synergy guides case\\nanalysis, revealing transferable lessons for urban-rural adaptation.\\nThe SES framework (Ostrom, 2009) provides a complementary\\nperspective by focusing on the interdependence of environmental\\nsystems and the human communities embedded within them. It\\nforegrounds issues of adaptability, self-organization, and resilience,\\nkey to understanding how rural populations respond to stressors like\\nclimate change and infrastructure collapse. Through the SES lens,\\nwe examine:\\ni) Local adaptation strategies, including rainwater harvesting,\\ninformal water-sharing networks, and traditional\\nknowledge systems.\\nii) Community governance structures, such as Water User\\nAssociations and local leadership dynamics.\\niii) Social vulnerabilities, including power asymmetries that\\nmediate access to water.\\nThe value of integrating IWRM and SES lies in bridging the top-\\ndown and bottom-up dimensions of water governance. IWRM helps\\nexplain why well-intentioned policies often fail, due to fragmented\\ninstitutions, weak enforcement, and political inertia (Enqvist and\\nZiervogel, 2019). SES, on the other hand, explains how communities\\nsurvive despite these failures, through locally driven coping and\\nadaptation mechanisms as shown inFigure 3captures the feedback\\nloops between IWRM’s governance nodes (policy coordination,\\nresource allocation) and SES ’s community loops (adaptation,\\nsocial networks), illustrating how policy reforms enable local\\nresilience and community actions inform governance ( Global\\nWater Partnership, 2000; Ostrom, 2009).\\nThis integrated approach also guided our case selection strategy,\\nfavoring cases that reﬂect: (i) diverse governance arrangements\\n(national programs vs. local projects), contrasting community\\nresilience outcomes (urban vs. rural), and availability of reliable\\ndata for cross-case analysis. By weaving these frameworks together,\\nwe provide a systems-level understanding of rural water scarcity that\\naccounts for both structural constraints and grassroots innovations.\\nThis duality is critical to designing interventions that are not only\\ntechnically sound but socially grounded and institutionally feasible.\\n2.1 Case study selection\\nThe selection of case studies, Cape Town ’s “Day Zero ”\\n(2017–2018), Greater Giyani’s Bulk Water Supply Project, and\\nMuyexe’s Comprehensive Rural Development Programme (CRDP)\\nensure analytical depth and alignment with the IWRM-SES\\nframework. Four criteria guided selection: contextual diversity, data\\nrichness, policy/community relevance, and comparative value. Cape\\nTown, an urban conservation case, showcases IWRM-driven policy\\nsuccess (58% consumption drop) but reveals SES inequities (low-\\nincome burdens) (Booysen and Ripunda, 2021). Its urban focus may\\noveremphasize governance, mitigated by rural cases. Giyani, a rural\\ninfrastructure failure, highlights coordination gaps and\\nmismanagement, and dealing with its extreme corruption may not\\nrepresent all projects (Jovanovic et al., 2022). Muyexe’sC R D Pa n d\\nrainwater harvesting (40% supply increase) reﬂect SES resilience but\\nface IWRM policy gaps (maintenance failures) ( Mathe, 2018;\\nMatimolane et al., 2024). Its small scale limits scalability, offset by\\nLimpopo’s broader adoption. Collectively, these cases span urban-\\nrural and policy-community contexts, supported by peer-reviewed\\ndata, enabling IWRM-SES synthesis. Despite their strengths, the\\nselected cases have limitations. Cape Town ’s urban focus may\\noveremphasize policy success, less applicable to rural contexts with\\nlimited infrastructure (Booysen and Ripunda, 2021).

By applying the IWRM and SES frameworks, we explore\\nhow prolonged droughts, erratic rainfall, and extreme temperatures\\nhave impacted water availability, governance capacity, and\\ncommunity adaptation in both urban and rural contexts. One of\\nthe most well-documented examples is the 2017–2018 “Day Zero”\\ncrisis in Cape Town, when municipal dam levels dropped below 20%,\\nthreatening to cut off water supply to over 4 million residents. In\\nresponse, the city implemented aggressive demand-side strategies,\\nincluding daily household limits (50 L per person), public awareness\\ncampaigns, and the deployment of smart water meters (Booysen and\\nRipunda, 2021). These measures succeeded in halving daily water\\nconsumption, from 1.2 billion to approximately 500 million liters, but\\nalso revealed equity concerns. Wealthier households could afford\\nwater storage systems, while lower-income communities endured the\\nmost usage restrictions (Calverley and Walther, 2022). From an\\nIWRM perspective, this response showcased effective short-term\\ndemand management but lacked long-term structural reform. SES\\ninsights further highlight the adaptive capacity of communities but\\nalso expose systemic disparities in access to resilience tools.\\nIn rural Limpopo and the Eastern Cape, recurring droughts have\\nseverely depleted surface water supplies. Dams such as Nsami and\\nMiddle Letaba fell to critical levels during the 2015 –2016 and\\n2019 droughts, disrupting water access for both households and\\nagriculture (Jovanovic et al., 2022). These regions illustrate how low\\ninfrastructure redundancy and limited institutional coordination\\ncompound climate risks. Governance responses were largely\\nreactive, often relying on temporary water trucking or donor\\ninterventions. Through the SES lens, rural communities displayed\\ncoping mechanisms, such as rainwater harvesting and informal\\nwater-sharing, but these efforts remained constrained without\\nexternal support. Climate shocks have also affected the\\nagricultural and tourism sectors, which are both water-intensive\\nand economically signi ﬁcant. Farmers in the Free State have\\nincreasingly turned to conservation agriculture and drought-\\nresistant crops in response to shifting rainfall patterns, while\\nregions like the Kruger National Park face biodiversity threats\\ndue to shrinking waterholes and altered animal migration\\npatterns ( Geißler et al., 2024 ; Mathivha et al., 2017 ). These\\nimpacts underscore the need for anticipatory governance and\\nﬂexible infrastructure planning. Yet, current frameworks for\\ninter-sectoral coordination remain weak, limiting the ability of\\nnational and provincial governments to manage water trade-offs\\neffectively (Makaya et al., 2020).\\nGiyani’s Bulk Water Supply Project, delayed by corruption,\\nproject failures forced communities to rely on contaminated\\nrivers, highlighting IWRM governance failures ( Makaya et al.,\\n2020). Muyexe’s rainwater harvesting increased supply by 40%,\\nbut elite control in Water User Associations limited equitable\\naccess, reﬂecting SES power dynamics (Mpongwana et al., 2022).\\nIn Cape Town, while restrictions halved consumption,Calverley and\\nWalther (2022) note low-income burdens, though others argue\\nuniversal limits ensured fairness (Ziervogel et al., 2014).

These efforts focus on\\nencouraging communities to adopt water-saving practices and\\nimplementing policies that ensure the ef ﬁcient management of\\nwater resources for the future.\\nOne prominent initiative in South Africa is the Water\\nConservation and Water Demand Management Strategy, adopted\\nby the government in 2004 to promote water-use efﬁciency in urban\\nand agricultural sectors (Department of Water Affairs and Forestry,\\n2004). This strategy aims to reduce the demand for water by\\npromoting water-use ef ﬁciency, particularly in urban and\\nagricultural sectors. For example, the Western Cape Province has\\nintroduced policies to reduce water use in the agricultural sector by\\npromoting the use of drip irrigation systems, which deliver water\\ndirectly to plant roots, minimizing waste ( Visser et al., 2021).\\nAdditionally, the city of Cape Town implemented water-saving\\nmeasures during the 2017 –2018 drought, including restrictions\\non water use, the promotion of water-saving devices, and public\\nawareness campaigns (Beck et al., 2016). While some of these efforts,\\nsuch as the promotion of efﬁcient irrigation methods, have yielded\\npositive results, they also faced challenges. During the severe\\n2017–2018 drought, Cape Town implemented aggressive water\\nconservation measures through the “Day Zero ” campaign,\\nincluding strict household water restrictions (50 L per person per\\nday), installation of smart water meters, and mass public awareness\\ncampaigns. These efforts achieved remarkable short-term success,\\nreducing the city’s daily water consumption from 1.2 billion liters to\\napproximately 500 million liters (Booysen and Ripunda, 2021).\\nHowever, a critical analysis reveals that the measures\\ndisproportionately burden low-income communities, with limited\\naccess to alternative water storage solutions such as private\\nboreholes or rainwater tanks ( Calverley and Walther, 2022 ).\\nWealthier households could adapt more easily, revealing\\npersistent socio-economic inequalities in water access. Although\\nthe campaign succeeded in averting catastrophic municipal water\\nfailure, it underlined the urgent need for more inclusive and\\nequitable planning in demand management strategies,\\nparticularly for vulnerable populations. In contrast, awareness\\ncampaigns like Water Wise proved more sustainable in the long\\nterm, as they fostered lasting behavioral changes, and a greater\\npublic understanding of water conservation needs Calverley and\\nWalther (2022).\\n4.2 Water treatment and\\npuriﬁcation programs\\nWater contamination is another critical issue affecting rural\\nSouth Africa, where many communities rely on untreated surface\\nwater sources (Odiyo et al., 2020). To address this, several water\\ntreatment and puriﬁcation programs have been rolled out. One such\\nprogram is the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Program, which\\nfocuses on improving access to clean water in rural areas by\\nproviding water treatment plants and improving sanitation\\nsystems ( McDaid et al., 2018 ). In areas like Limpopo and\\nKwaZulu-Natal, water treatment facilities have been established\\nto purify surface water, making it safe for consumption. The\\nWater Research Commission (2022) has also developed low-cost\\nﬁltration systems, which are being implemented in rural schools and\\nhouseholds, helping to reduce the incidence of waterborne diseases\\nsuch as cholera and dysentery. In rural Limpopo, the\\nimplementation of small-scale water treatment plants and\\ncommunity ﬁltration systems under the Rural Water Supply and\\nSanitation Program signiﬁcantly improved public health outcomes,\\nnotably reducing cholera and dysentery cases by an estimated 35%\\nbetween 2016 and 2019 (McDaid et al., 2018). While the technical\\nsuccess of these interventions is evident, their long-term\\nsustainability remains questionable. Many rural treatment\\nfacilities suffer from underfunding, inadequate technical support,\\nand insufﬁcient community training, leading to system failures and\\nmaintenance backlogs. This points to a critical weakness: without\\nongoing institutional and ﬁnancial support, initial infrastructure\\ngains risk rapid deterioration. Thus, while the program\\ndemonstrates that decentralized water treatment can improve\\nhealth outcomes, its success is fragile and contingent on\\ncontinued investment and capacity-building.\\n4.3 Community empowerment and\\nparticipation in water conservation\\nEmpowering local communities to participate in water\\nmanagement is crucial for the sustainability of water resources.\\nIn South Africa, several community-driven initiatives have been\\nlaunched to encourage local participation in water conservation.\\nOne example is the Community Water Supply and Sanitation\\nProgram in the Free State, where communities are involved in\\nthe planning, construction, and maintenance of water supply\\ninfrastructure. This approach ensures that the projects are\\ntailored to the speciﬁc needs of the community and are more\\nsustainable in the long term ( Soares et al., 2024). Educational\\ncampaigns have also been crucial in raising awareness about the\\nimportance of water conservation. Programs like Water Wise, led by\\nthe WRC, educate communities on how to reduce water\\nconsumption and adopt water-saving practices. The campaign\\nhas reached millions of South Africans, encouraging practices\\nsuch as ﬁxing leaking taps, using water-efﬁcient appliances, and\\npromoting rainwater harvesting (Filho et al., 2022; Calverley and\\nWalther, 2022).\\n4.4 The Comprehensive Rural\\nDevelopment Programme\\nIn addition to water conservation initiatives, the South African\\ngovernment has launched several large-scale programs to address\\nbroader socio-economic challenges in rural areas. One of the key\\ninitiatives is the CRDP, which was launched in 2009. The CRDP\\nprioritizes the needs of rural communities, ranging from clean water\\nand proper sanitation to decent housing and enterprise development\\nsupport. Muyexe Village in the Greater Giyani Local Municipality,\\nLimpopo, became theﬁrst pilot project for the CRDP (Mathe, 2018).\\nThis village served as a model for integrating water access with\\nbroader development goals.

Project\\nevaluations noted delays in infrastructure delivery, inconsistent\\nwater supply due to inadequate maintenance, and limited\\ncommunity involvement in decision-making processes. These\\nshortcomings suggest that while the CRDP offers a promising\\nmodel for holistic rural development, its long-term success\\ndepends on embedding stronger participatory mechanisms and\\nensuring that infrastructure investments are accompanied by\\nrobust operation and maintenance systems.

One of the most effective solutions has been the\\nimplementation of rainwater harvesting systems ( Mwenge-\\nKahinda et al., 2010 ). In areas such as the Northern Cape,\\nMpumalanga, and Limpopo Province, rainwater harvesting has\\nbecome a key strategy for improving water resilience\\n(Matimolane et al., 2023; Judeh et al., 2022). By collecting and\\nstoring rainwater, households, and schools can reduce their reliance\\non municipal water systems, which are often unreliable, particularly\\nduring drought periods. The installation of rainwater harvesting\\ntanks has proven to be a cost-effective and sustainable solution for\\nmany rural communities (Matimolane et al., 2023). In addition to\\nrainwater harvesting, solar-powered water puriﬁcation technologies\\nare providing a reliable and sustainable solution for rural\\ncommunities with limited access to electricity. One example is\\nthe use of solar-powered reverse osmosis systems in remote areas\\nof Limpopo and Mpumalanga, which help purify contaminated\\nwater and provide clean drinking water to off-grid communities.\\nThese technologies offer a long-term solution to water puriﬁcation\\nchallenges while utilizing renewable energy, reducing both\\nenvironmental and ﬁnancial costs (UNDP, 2017).\\n5 Discussion\\nThe interplay between governance failures and community\\nresilience underscores the importance of using both the IWRM\\nand SES frameworks to analyze South Africa’s rural water crisis.\\nWhile IWRM identiﬁes critical gaps in policy implementation and\\nresource distribution, SES provides insight into how local\\ncommunities navigate these challenges through adaptation and\\nself-organization. In much of rural South Africa, water scarcity\\nstems from a complex interplay of climate variability, governance\\ninefﬁciencies, and socio-economic disparities (Makaya et al., 2020).\\nWhile signiﬁcant progress has been made in policy development,\\nsuch as theNational Water Act (1998), implementation gaps remain\\na critical barrier to equitable water access (Nkosi et al., 2021; Makaya\\net al., 2020 ). These gaps stem from poor intergovernmental\\ncoordination, corruption, and inadequate technical capacity at\\nthe local level. For example, the failure of the Giyani Bulk Water\\nSupply Project, which remains incomplete despite signi ﬁcant\\ninvestments, highlights systemic governance failures that leave\\nrural communities vulnerable to water insecurity. South Africa’s\\nexperience with rural water interventions demonstrates that\\ntechnical solutions alone are insuf ﬁcient to ensure sustainable\\noutcomes. Projects that achieved short-term success, such as\\nCape Town’s aggressive water-saving measures and Limpopo ’s\\nrainwater harvesting programs, did so in contexts where public\\nengagement, local leadership, and sufﬁcient resourcing aligned. In\\ncontrast, large-scale infrastructure efforts like the Giyani Bulk Water\\nSupply Project, which remains incomplete despite signi ﬁcant\\nﬁnancial investments, illustrate how governance failures,\\ncorruption, and weak intergovernmental coordination can derail\\neven well-funded initiatives (Makaya et al., 2020). These contrasting\\nexperiences highlight that future strategies must not only emphasize\\ninnovative technologies or infrastructure expansion but must also\\ncritically address institutional capacity, transparency, and equity to\\nachieve durable water security outcomes. Using the dual lenses of\\nIWRM and SES theory, we discuss and extract key cross-cutting\\ninsights that underpin sustainable and equitable water governance in\\nSouth Africa.\\n5.1 Policy ambition vs. delivery failure\\nSouth Africa’s water governance framework is among the most\\nprogressive globally, anchored in the constitutional right to water\\nand operationalized through the National Water Act (1998) .\\nHowever, the Giyani Bulk Water Supply Project, despite high-\\nlevel policy support and substantial public investment, remains a\\ncase study of implementation failure. Delays, cost overruns, poor\\ncontractor oversight, and bureaucratic inertia reﬂect the challenges\\nof turning ambitious policies into functioning infrastructure. The\\nIWRM framework emphasizes coordination, accountability, and\\nplanning integration, all of which broke down in Giyani. This\\nreﬂects a broader phenomenon where governance structures\\nremain siloed, with weak vertical alignment between national and\\nlocal actors and limited cross-sectoral coordination. Water\\nmanagement responsibilities are fragmented across departments,\\nwith municipalities often lacking the technical andﬁnancial capacity\\nto fulﬁll their mandates. As a result, service delivery suffers, and\\nprojects stall or fail entirely. The lesson is clear: without institutional\\ncoherence and capacity at the local level, national water policy goals\\ncannot be realized.\\n5.2 Resilience from below: the role and limits\\nof community adaptation\\nIn contrast to top-down failures, rural communities have\\ndemonstrated remarkable, though often overlooked, resilience in\\nFrontiers in Environmental Science frontiersin.org07\\nMatimolane and Mathivha 10.3389/fenvs.2025.1550738'),\n",

Rainwater harvesting, rotational water-\\nsharing systems, and the use of traditional knowledge networks are\\nwidespread in villages like Muyexe. These practices exemplify the\\nSES framework’s core principles, adaptation, self-organization, and\\nlocal knowledge embedded within environmental systems.\\nHowever, this resilience is often born of necessity rather than\\nempowerment. Communities compensate for the failures of the\\nstate, often without institutional support, ﬁnancial resources, or\\nlong-term security. Moreover, community adaptation is not\\nuniformly inclusive. In some cases, local elites dominate water\\ncommittees, and women and low-income groups are\\nunderrepresented in decision-making, reinforcing existing\\ninequalities. These internal governance asymmetries are rarely\\naddressed in formal water policies, which often assume a\\nhomogenous and cooperative “community.” Therefore, while\\nSES-informed approaches highlight important adaptation\\npathways, they also caution against romanticizing local resilience\\nin the absence of structural support and accountability mechanisms.\\nEmpowerment must be coupled with resourcing and inclusion to\\nmake bottom-up governance viable and equitable.\\n5.3 Technology as enabler, not substitute\\nThe Cape Town“Day Zero” crisis exempliﬁed how data, public\\ncommunication, and behavioral interventions can reshape water\\nconsumption patterns under extreme conditions. Technological\\ntools, such as smart metering, mobile alerts, and AI-driven leak\\ndetection, played a signiﬁcant role in halving water usage during the\\npeak of the crisis (Visser et al., 2021). However, these interventions\\nwere easier to deploy in a resource-rich, urban context with strong\\ninstitutional backing and literate, digitally connected residents. In\\nrural contexts, the promise of smart technologies must be tempered\\nby considerations of local infrastructure, technical capacity, and\\naffordability. Solar-powered puriﬁcation units, remote sensors, and\\nAI models for predictive maintenance hold real potential, but only if\\nintroduced through phased, community-inclusive pilots with\\ntraining and ongoing support. This is where the IWRM\\nframework must intersect with SES: technology planning must be\\nco-designed with communities and embedded in existing\\ngovernance and environmental systems. Otherwise, tech-based\\ninterventions risk becoming “parachute solutions ” that fail\\nto take root.\\n5.4 Learning loops between urban and rural\\nwater governance\\nFinally, the case studies suggest an untapped opportunity for\\nurban-rural learning loops. The institutional innovations and\\nbehavior change strategies used in Cape Town, such as aggressive\\ndemand management, could be adapted for use in rural areas,\\nespecially in small towns or peri-urban municipalities facing\\nsimilar drought stress. Conversely, the participatory structures\\nseen in Muyexe’s CRDP and traditional water-sharing practices\\nin Limpopo could inform more inclusive and resilient models for\\nurban informal settlements. Currently, these insights remain siloed.\\nNational learning platforms are weak, and policy knowledge transfer\\nis slow or non-existent. Institutional structures do not encourage\\nhorizontal exchange between municipalities, and donor-funded\\npilots often operate in isolation. Bridging these divides would\\nrequire a dedicated mechanism, possibly through the Water\\nResearch Commission or SALGA, to facilitate inter-municipal\\ndialogue, peer learning, and cross-scalar innovation diffusion.\\n5.5 Synthesis: reimagining water governance\\nthrough dual frameworks\\nCollectively, these insights point to the need for a hybrid\\ngovernance model that draws on the strengths of both IWRM\\nand SES. The Integrated Water Resource Management\\nframework provides the institutional scaffolding, laws, roles,\\nresource allocation, and planning tools, while SES reminds us\\nthat governance is lived, and shaped by relationships, histories,\\nand community-level dynamics. Neither framework alone is\\nsufﬁcient. But when combined, they offer a more realistic and\\nactionable roadmap for addressing water scarcity, especially in\\nrural South Africa, where formal and informal systems are deeply\\nintertwined.\\n6 Recommendations: pathways to\\nsustainability, innovative directions for\\naddressing water scarcity\\nAchieving sustainable rural water security in rural South Africa\\nrequires a hybrid approach that integrates IWRM’s policy-driven\\nsolutions with SES’s community-centered strategies. While top-\\ndown governance reforms are necessary to enhance infrastructure\\nand regulatory oversight, bottom-up innovations must also be\\nsupported to foster local resilience and adaptive capacity. The\\noutlook for sustainable water management in the future is shaped\\nby the growing demand for freshwater, increasing population,\\nclimate change, and environmental degradation. While the\\nchallenges are immense, there are also signiﬁcant opportunities\\nto implement strategies and technologies that can promote long-\\nterm water sustainability. According to the United Nations, global\\nwater demand is projected to increase by 55% by 2050, largely driven\\nby industrial, agricultural, and domestic needs (United Nations,\\n2020). This increasing demand, combined with climate change and\\npopulation growth, will put further strain on freshwater resources.\\nWater scarcity in rural South Africa is an escalating crisis driven by\\nclimate change, governance inef ﬁciencies, and socio-economic\\ndisparities (Hedden and Cilliers, 2014)\\nThus, addressing these challenges will require the integration of\\ninnovative technologies, strong governance, community\\nparticipation, and global cooperation. The South African case\\nstudies suggest that successful water management requires a\\nhybrid model that marries technical innovation with robust\\ngovernance and community engagement. Emerging technologies,\\nsuch as AI-driven water monitoring systems successfully piloted in\\nurban Cape Town, offer promise if adapted to rural contexts with\\nsensitivity to socio-economic disparities. However, technology alone\\ncannot overcome structural governance challenges.

Replication efforts\\nelsewhere must critically adapt these lessons rather than blindly\\ntransplanting strategies, recognizing that context-speci ﬁc\\ngovernance and social dynamics are crucial determinants of success.\\n6.1 Recalibrate intergovernmental\\ncoordination and strengthen accountability\\nOne of the most pressing governance gaps lies in the\\nmisalignment between national policy goals and municipal\\ndelivery capacity. A dedicated intergovernmental National Rural\\nWater Taskforce, housed within the Department of Water and\\nSanitation (DWS), should be established to coordinate funding\\nﬂows, project oversight, and technical standards across spheres of\\ngovernment. The South African Local Government Association\\n(SALGA) and the National Treasury should co-develop\\nperformance-based funding mechanisms that reward\\nmunicipalities for meeting service benchmarks. This reform is\\nhighly feasible given existing structures, but it requires political\\nwill and moderate administrative investment. Scaling up nationally\\nwould involve aligning Municipal Infrastructure Grants (MIGs)\\nwith newly established performance metrics.\\n6.2 Invest in decentralized climate-resilient\\ninfrastructure\\nRural areas remain underserved by conventional bulk supply\\nsystems, which are often high-cost, delay-prone, and maintenance-\\nintensive. Instead, investments should shift toward modular,\\ndecentralized infrastructure: solar-powered water puri ﬁcation\\nunits, gravity-fed rainwater harvesting, and mobile treatment\\nplants for remote settlements. These systems are not only more\\ncost-effective (averaging 30%–60% less than centralized schemes per\\nhousehold served) (Water Research Commission, 2022), but also\\nquicker to deploy. The Department of Cooperative Governance\\n(COGTA) and the Municipal Infrastructure Support Agency\\n(MISA), in partnership with NGOs and local engineeringﬁrms,\\nshould pilot community-scale projects in high-risk districts. With\\nproper local training, these technologies are highly scalable\\nacross provinces.\\n6.3 Institutionalize inclusive, community-\\nbased water governance\\nThe resilience demonstrated by communities in Muyexe and\\nLimpopo highlights the potential of local governance structures, but\\nalso their vulnerabilities. Municipalities should formalize Water\\nUser Associations (WUAs) and ward-level water committees\\nthrough municipal bylaws while ensuring compliance with\\nnational standards on gender and youth representation.\\nTraditional councils and civil society organizations (e.g.,\\ncommunity trusts, and water cooperatives) should be included in\\nplanning dialogues. While relatively low-cost, this reform requires\\ninvestment in capacity-building and facilitation, especially in\\nlinguistically and culturally diverse regions. COGTA and SALGA\\ncan coordinate nationwide replication using existing ward-\\nbased systems.\\n6.4 Deploy appropriate technology with\\nbuilt-in capacity development\\nSmart technologies, such as AI-enabled leak detection, ﬂow\\nmonitoring, and predictive analytics for drought response, hold\\nimmense potential. However, their effectiveness in rural settings\\nhinges on affordability, simplicity, and local ownership. The DWS\\nInnovation Hub, in collaboration with research institutions like the\\nCouncil for Scientiﬁc and Industrial Research and local universities,\\nshould lead co-designed pilot programs that include not only\\nhardware but also technical training and follow-up support. The\\ncost of these systems varies from approximately R37,000 to\\nR92,500 per installation (UNDP, 2017), depending on scale but is\\nrecoverable over time through water loss reduction. Scalability is\\ncontingent on integrating operations and maintenance costs into\\nmunicipal budgeting processes and ensuring local repair capacity.\\n6.5 Embed climate forecasting and early\\nwarning systems in municipal planning\\nThe increasing frequency and severity of droughts demand\\nproactive, data-driven governance. Municipalities should embed\\nseasonal forecasting, hydrological stress modeling, and early-\\nwarning systems into Integrated Development Plans (IDPs). This\\nrequires partnerships with the South African Weather Service,\\nWRC, and provincial disaster management centers, which already\\npossess much of the technical infrastructure. Costs are moderate and\\nprimarily involve data access, software integration, and training, well\\nwithin the reach of national grant instruments. This initiative is\\nhighly feasible and should be prioritized in the most water-stressed\\nmunicipalities, such as those in Limpopo, Eastern Cape, and\\nNorthern Cape.\\n6.6 Mobilize blendedﬁnance and climate-\\naligned investment\\nMany rural water projects stall due to erratic funding cycles and\\na lack of long-term capital for maintenance. The National Treasury,\\nin coordination with the DBSA and international partners (e.g., GIZ,\\nGreen Climate Fund), should develop blendedﬁnance mechanisms\\nthat combine public subsidies with concessional loans and private\\ncapital. These can support decentralized infrastructure, technology\\ndeployment, and ongoing operations.

Like South Africa, rural India faces groundwater\\ndepletion, but community-led watershed management has\\nimproved resilience ( Jain et al., 2021 ). In the Sahel,\\ndecentralized water committ ees resemble South Africa ’sW a t e r\\nUser Associations but struggle with funding ( United Nations,\\n2020). Thus, the country’s experience with Cape Town’s “Day\\nZero” highlights the importance of integrating water conservation,\\npublic awareness, and governance reforms during periods of\\nextreme scarcity, all together playing a pivotal role in averting a\\ncomplete water supply collapse ( Enqvist and Ziervogel, 2019 ;\\nCalverley and Walther, 2022). These lessons can inform water-\\nstressed regions worldwide about the ef ﬁcacy of coordinated\\nresponses and community-dr iven conservation efforts ( Enqvist\\nand Ziervogel, 2019). South Africa’s unique socio-economic and\\nenvironmental challenges position it as a valuable case study for\\nglobal water management. Cape Town’s “Day Zero” highlights the\\nefﬁcacy of integrating conservation, awareness, and governance\\nreforms to avert supply collapse (Enqvist and Ziervogel, 2019). The\\nNational Water Act (1998)demonstrates progressive governance,\\nemphasizing equitable access and sustainability, and adaptability\\nglobally (Schreiner, 2013). By leveraging technologies and crisis\\nmanagement, South Africa can lead in climate-resilient water\\nsystems, informing regions like India and the Sahel ( Olley\\net al., 2024).\\nDespite challenges in implementation and reform, the act\\nemphasizes equitable access, sustainable use, and ecosystem\\nprotection, principles that can be adapted globally (Olley et al.,\\n2024). By adopting emerging technologies and building on its\\nexperiences, South Africa has the opportunity to lead in\\ndeveloping climate-resilient and inclusive water management\\nsystems. These innovations, combined with proactive crisis\\nmanagement strategies, can serve as a model for regional and\\nglobal efforts to tackle the interconnected challenges of water\\nscarcity, governance, and climate change.\\n7 Concluding remarks\\nThis perspective has argued that addressing rural water scarcity\\nin South Africa requires an integrated, multi-scalar governance\\nmodel that reconciles the structural logic of IWRM with the\\nadaptive, localized insights of the SES theory. By examining\\ndiverse case studies, Cape Town’s Day Zero campaign, the Giyani\\nBulk Water Supply Project, and the Muyexe Comprehensive Rural\\nDevelopment Programme, we demonstrated how both top-down\\ninstitutional failures and bottom-up adaptive responses shape water\\noutcomes across rural and peri-urban landscapes. The core\\ncontribution of this work lies in its framework-driven synthesis.\\nThe IWRM framework provides a lens to critique systemic\\ninefﬁciencies: misaligned mandates, funding gaps, regulatory\\nbreakdowns, and siloed institutional processes. The SES theory,\\nin contrast, reveals how communities mobilize traditional\\nknowledge, social networks, and informal governance\\nmechanisms to survive in the absence of reliable state support.\\nWhen used in tandem, these frameworks illuminate the tensions and\\nopportunities between formal water policy and lived realities,\\nhighlighting both systemic constraints and pathways for\\ntransformation.\\nThis perspective does not claim to present new empirical data;\\nrather, it offers a thematic integration and analytical reframing of\\nexisting evidence. It responds to the growing need for cross-\\nframework approaches to diagnose governance complexity and\\ninform more socially responsive water interventions. The\\nrecommendations, ranging from decentralized infrastructure and\\nclimate forecasting to AI-enabled monitoring and participatory\\ngovernance, are grounded in this dual-framework logic and\\ntailored to South Africa ’s institutional and ecological realities.\\nFuture research should test these propositions empirically by\\nexploring the conditions under which community-based\\ngovernance models succeed or fail, the political economy of rural\\ninfrastructure ﬁnancing, and the scalability of technological\\ninnovations in off-grid environments. In particular, there is a\\nneed for interdisciplinary ﬁeldwork that engages both\\npolicymakers and rural communities to co-produce knowledge\\naround sustainable water futures.

This report is published as part of the OECD \\nProgramme on Water Security for Sustainable Development in Africa , launched in 2018 by the OECD \\nSecretary-General Mr Angel Gurría, the recipient of the 6th edition of the King Hassan II Great World Water \\nPrize.   \\nAchieving the Sustainable Development Goal number 6 on “Clean Water and Sanitation” and other water-\\nrelated targets by 2030, requires that national and loca l governments put in place the enabling conditions \\nto effectively manage risks of too much, too little or too polluted water, while providing access to water \\nquality services to all. If no action is taken, it is estimated that by 2050, more than 160 millio n people in \\nAfrica will be living in urban areas with a perennial water shortage. The need to address these pressing \\nhealth and hygiene challenges for the 40% of sub -Saharan African citizens lacking basic access to water \\nsupply and the 70% lacking access t o basic sanitation, has only been magnified by the COVID -19 \\npandemic . \\nMegatrends related to climate change, urbanisation and demographic shifts will further exacerbate \\npressures on water resources. The African continent is one of the most exposed to climate change impacts. \\nMoreover, between now and 2050, two thirds of on -going urbanisation will happen in towns and \\nintermediary cities, which have less capacity to deploy enabling and mitigating infrastructure than larger \\nones. \\nBuilding on a survey across 36 cities of all sizes in Africa, this report provides a regional analysis of who \\ndoes what in water management, the effectiveness of institutional, policy and regulatory frameworks, as \\nwell as the critical governance gaps that need to be bridged in order to boost the capacity of all towns and \\ncities to drive water security in the African continent. This first ever comprehensive analysis of water \\ngovernance challenges at the local level in Africa aims not only to raise awareness of pressing and \\nemerging issues that urban areas face, but also to galvanise political action from Mayors and city leaders.  \\nIn order to provide momentum to the policy dialogue underlying this report and the evidence it brings,  a \\n‘Roundtable of African Mayors for Water Security’ - is being launched as a Policy Forum to share best \\npractices and guide policy reforms and actions on the road to the 9 th World Water Forum, to be held in \\nDakar, Senegal in March 2022 . We invite all African mayors to join this platform as a signal of their \\ncommitment to the water cause and of their political impetus to improve local water policies for better urban \\nresidents’ well-being. \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\nAngel Gurria \\nOECD Secretary-General \\nAbdelkader Amara \\nMinister of Equipment, Transport, \\nLogistics and Water, Morocco \\nJean-Pierre Elong Mbassi \\nSecretary-General of \\nUCLG-Africa \\nLoic Fauchon \\nPresident of the World Water \\nCouncil'),\n",

This special focus on \\nAfrican cities contributes to the expansion of the global outreach of the OECD’s work, thus adding to \\nregional analyses of water governance in OECD countries (2011), Latin America and the Caribbean (2012) \\nand Asia-Pacific (2020), as well as national water governance policy dialogues in Mexico (2013), The \\nNetherlands (2014), Jordan (2015), Tunisia (2015), Brazil (2015 and 2017), Argentina (2019) and Peru \\n(2021).  \\nThe regional spotlight on Africa contributes to the preparatory process of the 9th World Water Forum to be \\nheld in Dakar, Senegal (March 2022), in which the OECD co-leads the “Implementation Means and Tools” \\nPriority. This report is also an output from the OECD Programme on Water Securit y for Sustainable \\nDevelopment in Africa, launched in 2018 by the OECD Secretary General; the recipient of the 6 th edition \\nof the King Hassan II Great World Water Prize, during the 8th World Water forum in Brasilia, Brazil (March \\n2018).  \\nThe focus on cities of all sizes aims to raise action from local leaders in driving water security in a continent \\nsubject to fast urbanisation. The report emphasises the essential role of cities to improve water governance \\nsystems that can secure the effective, efficient and  inclusive provision of drinking water and sanitation to \\nall citizens but also to manage mounting challenges related to floods, droughts and water pollution in a \\nshared responsibility with national governments.  \\nMayors and city leaders, who are closer to citizens and place-based needs, can significantly contribute to \\nthe management of water at the appropriate scale, while increasing trust in public policy, through \\nengagement with all stakeholders. This report and the resulting Mayors’ Roundtable for Water Security in \\nAfrica seek to accelerate action at all levels to reach SDG n°6 on “clean water and sanitation” in the \\ncontinent, and beyond.  \\nThis publication contributes to the work of the Regional Development Policy Committee (RDPC). It was \\napproved by RDPC delegates via written procedure on 18 February 2021 under the cote \\nCFE/RDPC(2021)2.'),\n",

With about 100 \\n000 COVID -19 related deaths as of February 2021, according to available statistics, Afri ca is not the \\nhardest-hit continent but African cities, alongside national governments, with higher population densities  \\nand large numbers of crowded places such as markets and public transport, have been acutely affected \\nby the need for policy action to contain the spread of the virus. \\nBefore the pandemic, African countries and cities were already facing mounting water challenges. In Sub-\\nSaharan Africa, for example, 40% of people lack basic access to water supply and 70% to basic sanitation, \\nin addition to challenges from concomitant floods, droughts and pollution. More specifically, in urban areas \\nof sub-Saharan Africa, only 20% have access to safely managed sanitation and 25% to basic sanitation, \\nwith significant variations across countries. According to  Joint Monitoring Programme reporting, in 2017, \\nonly 9% of the urban population in Liberia had access to safely managed water services compared to 99% \\nin South Africa, and these gaps have been growing since 2000. In addition to longstanding scarcity \\nchallenges, floods are the most frequent and widespread water -related disaster in Africa, particularly in \\nSub-Saharan Africa where 654 floods affected 38  million people over the last 33 years. In African cities, \\nflood risks (whether flash pluvial, costal or fluv ial) are exacerbated by rapid urbanisation, uncontrolled \\nurban growth and unregulated informal settlements on low -lying floodplain areas. Contaminated water is \\nanother major issue in Africa:  every hour, an estimated 115 people die from diseases related to improper \\nhygiene, poor sanitation or contaminated water.  \\nIn addition to the ongoing economic transformation of Africa, megatrends related to climate change, \\nurbanisation and population growth add pressure on water resources. It is estimated that the total number \\nof people living in urban areas with a perennial water shortage will increase to 162  million by 2050. \\nMoreover, Africa is among the most vulnerable continents to climate change, with projected temperatures \\nexpected to rise faster than the global average throughout the 21st century and two-thirds of African cities \\nat “extreme” risk of climate -related shocks; exacerbated by high population growth (4% per annum) and \\npoor urban infrastructure. No less than 86 of the 100 fastest-growing cities in the world are located in Africa \\nmost of which are sprawling extensively. Between now and 2050, two thirds of on -going urbanisation will \\nhappen in towns and intermediary cities, which have less capacity to deploy infrastructure than larger cities. \\nIn such a conte xt, reaching the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)  6 on “clean water \\nand sanitation” in order to leave no -one behind, is a daunting task, especially when proper water \\ngovernance conditions are not in place. \\nAs set out in the OECD Principles on Water Governance, coping with current and future water challenges \\nrequires robust public policies targeting measurable objectives in predetermined timeframes at the \\nappropriate scale and relying on a clear assignment of duties across responsible author ities and subject \\nto regular monitoring and evaluation. Water governance can greatly contribute to the design and \\nimplementation of such policies, in a shared responsibility across national, regional, basin and local levels'),\n",

Indeed, city governm ents hold policy prerogatives to \\nsecure the effective, efficient and inclusive provision of drinking water and sanitation as a local public \\nservice. In addition, mayors and city leaders, who are closer to citizens and place-based needs, could play \\na more s ignificant role in addressing the mismatch between hydrological and administrative boundaries, \\nthrough contributing to water resources management within integrated basin systems.  \\nBuilding on a water governance survey across 36 African cities of all sizes, this report provides a regional \\noverview of the allocation of roles and responsibilities for water management, the existence and \\nimplementation of institutional, policy and regulatory frameworks, as well as the critical governance gaps \\nthat need to be bridged in order to boost city government capacity to drive water security in the continent.  \\nKey findings of the OECD Survey on Water Governance in African Cities include: \\n\\uf0b7 In a majority of African countries, water policy is driven at the national level by a line ministry often \\nin charge of most regulatory functions, including tariff setting, quality standards definitions and \\nmonitoring, and consumer protection and engagement. A large number of African countries have \\nalso set up national water service providers, thus further amplifying the national leadership.  \\n\\uf0b7 The last decade has seen an increasing leadership of city governments in water policy. In addition \\nto national water policies, a significant  share of surveyed cities have adopted dedicated local \\npolicies, investment plans and programmes for drinking water and sanitation (75%) and  water \\nresource management (42%). A vast majority (80%) of cities that have adopted such local policies \\nreport that they contribute to overcoming silos that often generate poor planning, lack of policy \\ncoherence and misalignment of incentives. \\n\\uf0b7 Where they exist, local water policies usually facilitate co -ordination with strategic urban \\ndevelopment policies such as housing, land use and solid waste, and include social measures and \\ntargeted provisions towards vulnerable categories of the population in the form of a guaranteed \\nminimum water volume for basic needs, a social connection fee and/or a social tariff.  \\n\\uf0b7 In terms of evaluation and monitoring, half of the surveyed cities were hi ndered by partial and \\nincomplete water-related data and information to guide policymaking and decision-making..  \\n\\uf0b7 All surveyed cities consider the lack of funding as a major obstacle to good water governance, not \\nonly because of the limited use and uptake o f economic instruments, such as pollution and \\nabstraction charges, but also because between USD 9 billion and USD 14 billion would be needed \\nper year throughout the African continent to achieve water security.  \\n\\uf0b7 Less than half of the surveyed cities report the existence of clear procurement processes and \\nbudget transparency principles. Corruption remains a significant concern in many countries with \\nSub-Saharan Africa scoring the lowest in Transparency International’s annual Corruption \\nPerceptions Index; although with strong variations across countries.  \\n\\uf0b7 Finally, African cities report challenges in engaging with stakeholders in water-related matters due \\nto a lack of funding, time and staff, along with the complexity of the issues at hand. In addition, city \\ngovernments lack b asic knowledge about the stakeholders they should engage with:  more than \\nthree surveyed cities out of four have not carried out a stakeholder mapping for their water sector. \\nWhere such engagement practices exist, they rely on a variety of formal and informal mechanisms \\nincluding meetings (56%), workshops (44%), citizen committees (42%) and river basin \\norganisations (42%).'),\n",

Water \\nscarcity, water disasters and extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts, and failures of climate \\nchange mitigation and adaptation, rank as top global risks as assessed in the World Economic Forum ’s \\nGlobal Risks Report  (2020[1]). \\nThe OECD defines water security as the management of four water risks: \\n\\uf0b7 Risk of shortage and scarcity (including droughts): Lack of sufficient water to meet demand (in \\nboth the short and long run) for beneficial uses by all water users (households, businesses and the \\nenvironment). \\n\\uf0b7 Risk of inadequate quality: Lack of water of suitable quality for a particular purpose or use. \\n\\uf0b7 Risk of excess (including floods): Overflow of the normal confines of a water system (natural or \\nbuilt) or the destructive accumulation of water over areas that are not normally submerged . \\n\\uf0b7 Risk of inadequate access to safe water supply  and sanitation : Lack of access to safely \\nmanaged water and sanitation services (Figure 1.1). \\nFigure 1.1.

Over-abstraction and contamination of aquifers worldwide are posing significant challenges to \\nfood security, the health of ecosystems and safe drinking water supply. In addition, by 2050 and despite \\nglobal efforts, 240  million people are expected to remain without access to clean water and 1.4  billion \\nwithout access to basic sanitation. Significant investment is required to renew and upgrade infrastructure, \\nestimated at USD 6.7 trillion by 2050 for water supply and sanitation, and including a wider range of water-\\nrelated infrastructure that could triple that cost by 2030 (OECD, 2015[4]). \\nThe African continent is no exception to these observations as water security is already a major challenge \\nfor African countries and cities due to increased water demand tied to population growth, urbanisation and \\nclimate change impacts. Demographic  trends are pushing water demand up with the African urban \\npopulation projected to nearly double from more than 560  million in 2015 to 1.1  billion in 2050  (UN, \\n2015[5])). With 41% of the sub-Saharan African population currently living in cities, and a projected increase \\nto 60% by 205 0 (UN, 2015[5]), urbanisation will generate specific challenges related to access to quality \\ndrinking water and sanitation services. Climate change is also exacerbating the  pressure on water \\nresources with two -thirds of African cities estimated at “extreme risk” with regard to climate change \\nimpacts. The amount of gross domestic product (GDP) in African countries exposed to “extreme risk” will \\ngrow from USD  895 billion in 20 18 to USD  1 397 billion in 2023  (Verisk, Maplecroft, 2018 [6]), which \\nrepresents 48% of the African continent GDP. For instance, in sub -Saharan Africa, the cumulative effect \\nof the last decades indicates that floods and droughts  alone are responsible for around 80% of disaster -\\nrelated deaths and 70% of economic losses  (Ndaruzaniye et  al., 2010 [7]). Damages to infrastructure, \\nproperty and assets caused by tropical cyclones or flooding are among the more  obvious impacts but \\ndroughts, crop failure and instability brought by climate change may also move millions of people towards \\ncities through cross-border and rural migration (Verisk, Maplecroft, 2018[6]). \\nFurthermore, the late st monitoring results of United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 \\n“Clean water and sanitation” shows that significant or major challenges remain in all African countries, \\nwhile half of them are showing a stagnating trend towards achieving the va rious targets associated with \\nSDG 6 (Table 1.1). \\nTable 1.1.

Flash flood s result from high -intensity rainfall mostly occurring in steep slopes. Pluvial \\nfloods usually happen in urban areas in which drainage system capacity is overwhelmed by intense rainfall  \\n(Begum, Stive and Hall, 2007 [15]; Houston et  al., 2011[16]; Merz, Thieken and Gocht, 2007 [17]) (Vojinović, \\n2015[18]). Fluvial floods are triggered by excessive rainfall over a few hours causing a river to overtop \\nnatural or artificial defences and flood urban areas (Vojinović, 2015[18]). Coastal floods usually affect cities \\nthat are close to the ocean or the coasts as a result of seasonal storm surges (Vojinović, 2015[18]). The \\nOgunpa flood disaster that occurred in Ibadan, Nigeria, which led to more than 200 deaths and destroyed \\nassets worth millions of Nigerian Naira, was a combination of flash, fluvial and pluvial flooding  (Etuonovbe, \\n2011[19]). \\nUrbanisation which amplifies soil sealing in the built environment prevent rainfall from infiltrating into the \\nsoil, increasing the rate and volume of runoff during rainfall events. In Kampala, Uganda, the construction \\nof unregulated structures in informal settlements reduce d rainfall infiltration significantly, increasing runoff \\nto six times more than what would occur on natural terrain  (ActionAid, 2006[20]). While some of the increase \\nis likely due to climate change, it also largely results from land cover change. Thus, even moderate storms \\nproduce high flows, with more important and more frequent floods  (ActionAid, 2006[20]) (Satterthwaite, \\n2008[21]). \\nThe urban poor and those living in unplanned urban settlements are disproportionally affected by flooding \\n(see Douglas et al.   (2008[22]) for examples)  as, for instance, these settlements are commonly built on \\nmarginal land including flood -prone areas, as illustrat ed in cities like Lusaka (Zambia)  (Nchito, 2007[23]), \\nPort Elizabeth (South Africa) and Johannesburg (South Africa)  (Viljoen and Booysen, 2006[24]). In addition, \\nthe poor materials used for constructi on increase flood damages and fatality in informal settlements  \\n(Pharoah, 2014[25]). Frequent floods not only damage properties and result in direct loss of life but also \\ndisrupt traffic and expose people to health risks because of exposure to sewage, industrial waste and \\nwaterborne disease  (Lall, Henderson and Venables, 2017[26]). \\nInsufficient access to water and sanitation \\nAccording to JMP reporting (WHO/UNICEF, 2019[27]), urban access to safely managed piped water ranges \\nfrom 9% in Liberia to 99% in South Africa, with upward and downward evolution from 2000 to 2017. \\nDownward evolutions underline the difficulties that cities are facing to expand water infrastructure in a \\ncontext of urban population growth and unplanned urbanisation ( Table 1.4).

For instance, in Côte d’Ivoire, urban audits in 2013 showed \\nthat peri-urban and informal settlements are lacking adequate infrastructure and public services that are \\non the contrary present in the core of the cities. In Accra , Ghana, access to piped water, waste disposal \\nand toilet facilities decreas es as the distance to the city centre increases (Vinay, 2017 [29]). The same \\nsituation is observed in Maputo, Mozambique.  \\nPopulation growth and rapid outward urbanisation, among others, are already overwhelming existing urban \\ninfrastructure and challenge the capacity of institutions to respond to water demand. Economic growth and \\nthe emergence of a middle class with growing water needs will further add to that water demand. This is \\nparticularly alarming in a context of climate c hange and water scarcity. Some African cities are expected \\nto be particularly affected by this evolution, like Bamako (Mali), Kampala (Uganda), Lagos (Nigeria), \\nNiamey (Niger) and Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) as they are in areas at high risk of water stress   \\n(Vörösmarty et al., 2010[30]). \\nUsually, poor people living in informal settlements have to rely on multiple water sources (e.g.  boreholes, \\nrain harvesting, etc.) with increasing health risks due to unsafe drinking water.

This proportion is expected \\nto rise steadily as more and more people move to the city looking for work. Urban or peri-urban informal \\nsettlements are located nearby urban centres or an economic node, and are characterised by a lack of \\nformal town planning layout and approvals, a lack of formal tenure and informal housing without building \\nplans and related approvals (Housing Development Agency, South Africa, 2014[31]). \\nThere are currently 204 recognised informal settlements in Cape Town comprising 437 individual \\npockets. These pockets can be large blocks of hundreds of homes, small clusters of only a few homes \\nscattered on land in between formal houses, or individual homes on plots surrounded by food gardens. \\nThere is a wide variation in the number of households in a pocket, ranging from 3 in Chris Hani Pa rk \\npocket to nearly 8  000 in Enkanini pocket. Many of the informal settlements in Cape Town were \\nestablished before 2000 and are not recognised as permanent, and their residents lack occupation \\nrights and security of tenure. Only 17 pockets (4%) are less than 5 years old, around 286 pockets (65%) \\nwere established before the year 2000 and 103 (24%) were established before democracy.  \\nIn line with the national government policy, the city of Cape Town provides free basic water and \\nsanitation services to residents in informal settlements with 1 water tap per 25 families within a radius \\nof 200 m, and a minimum of 1 toilet per 5 families. As a whole, the city provides and maintains over \\n10 000 communal standpipes (taps) and over 50 000 toilets which are regularly cleaned. Most informal \\nsettlements have full flush (waterborne) toilets and these are generally preferred by both the city and \\ncommunities. However, it is not always possible to place flush toilets in areas that are vulnerable to \\nflooding, on unstable groun d (e.g.  former solid waste disposal sites), on private land or so densely'),\n",

Where there is incomplete coverage , informal markets fill residual needs and where the piped \\nwater reliability and quality is low, consumers turn to alternative supply sources. Thus, nearly half of the \\nurban African population relies on small-scale providers for a share of their water supply (Kariuki, 2005[34]).  \\nBox 1.2. Do informal markets crowd out formal water systems? \\nConventional economics would suggest that informal markets have evolved in response to policy \\nfailures and the uneven performance of formal utilities. In such cases, the formal and informal markets \\nare more likely to be complementary rather than competitors. However, competition (substitutability) \\ncould emerge in situations where the formal and inf ormal sectors compete for inputs (access to water) \\nor customers, or where the formal sector colludes with the informal to restrict access and expansion of \\ninfrastructure networks, which can drive demand for the informal sector. These are situations where the \\npresence of the informal sector may impede the growth of the formal sector, by reducing demand for or \\neroding profits of the formal sector. Bottled water markets, for instance, may also lead to lower \\nexpectations of water quality from water utilities (Hawkins, 2017[35]). \\nWhere formal and informal markets overlap (as they do for potable water almost universally) – \\ntwo outcomes may emerge. Consumers may benefit from greater choice and latent competition \\nbetween the sectors, res ulting in perhaps lower prices and better service. Most often such markets \\nbecome segmented – with private suppliers focusing upon a higher value -added niche – such as \\n“purified” drinking water. \\nThe existing evidence on the effect of informal markets on formal systems is patchy but broadly confirms \\nexpectations of economists; informal vendors fill a gap in formal water systems due to coverage, \\nreliability, quality  or all of the above. In the case of overlapping informal and formal systems for \\ndelivering drinking water, the evidence is less clear. There are examples of latent competition between \\nthe formal and informal sector with cases where the informal sector for sachet and bottled water has \\ngrown even where piped connections exist. This competition should lead to improved service quality for \\ndrinking water but the effect on price is less clear due to the differences between packed and piped \\nwater supplies, and the impact of subsidies on tariff structures for formal water systems.  \\nThe global experience sugg ests that the relationship between informal markets and formal water \\nsystems can also be complex. Informal markets are linked with formal systems in several ways which \\ncan both undermine and strengthen formal systems depending on the circumstances. First, informal \\nvendors often rely on public boreholes for some portion of their water supply. This has led to negotiation, \\nconcessions or memoranda of understanding to secure bulk water tariffs for informal vendors.  \\nInteractions between informal and formal systems can exacerbate corruption, including: rent extraction, \\nunofficial taxes by local and public officials and conflicts of interest when government officials operate \\nside businesses as informal vendors. Vendors regularly report conflicts with water utilities and complain'),\n",

The utility Águas da Região de Maputo reports \\na water coverage rate of 44% of the population, while about 500 small -scale providers manage over \\n800 piped systems and supply water to 50% of the population mostly through yard taps ( Box 1.3). \\nBox 1.3. The role of small-scale providers in Greater Maputo, Mozambique \\nThe metropolitan area of Maputo has between 1.7  million to 2 million inhabitants. The vast major ity of \\nhouseholds get their water from a yard tap or house connection. Maputo’s 500 or so water operators \\nprovide piped water services to about 191 000 households. This is more than the 185  000 households \\nserved by Águas da Região de Maputo (the main utili ty). The small-scale providers range in size, with \\nat least 1 serving 12 000 connections. \\nThe tariffs charged by small-scale providers are higher than those charged by the main utility, averaging \\nMZN 35 per m3, compared to the main utility’s charge of MZN 14 for the first social tariff block, MZN 19 \\nfor the next, and MZN 25 thereafter. Water providers developed because of the lack of service and poor \\nreliability of the public provider. Private households drilled boreholes for themselves; some then helped \\ntheir neighbours and translated this into a larger business serving more people. Small -scale operators \\nnow provide competing networks even in areas where a public network already exists. In some areas, \\nthe United States Agency for International Development  (USAID) survey found that small -scale \\nproviders were more reliable, provided a service for longer hours compared with the public provider. \\nMore recently, the public provider has experienced difficulties with the adequacy of its water supply and \\nhas reduced its hours of supply due to maintenance problems. \\nThe USAID survey also found that small -scale providers offer more flexible terms for payment. For \\nthese reasons, many customers prefer using a private provider rather than a public provider even when \\nthere is a choice and notwithstanding the higher tariff. Small -scale providers are 100% self -financed.'),\n",

The latter share has more tha n tripled, rising from 13.8% in \\n2010 to 43.1% in 2014  (Guzmán and Stoler, 2018 [41]), due to rapid urbanisation combined with \\nunderinvestment in infrastructure. The cost of water from informal vendors is generally five to seven times \\nhigher than piped water  (Vinay, 2017 [29]). Informal private vendors distribute water through several \\nmechanisms: half-litre plastic sachets sold in shops and on the streets , tanker services and trucks , and \\n15- to 20-litre containers.  \\nWater pollution \\nContaminated water is a major issue in Africa as every hour an estimated 115 people die from diseases \\nrelated to improper hygiene, poor s anitation or contaminated water  (UN, 2015[5]). Sanitation issues are \\namong the leading causes of disease transmission in Africa, especially for cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery  \\nand typhoid. Rapid urbanisation fairly contributes to the deterioration of water quality as cities are struggling \\nto provide adequate wastew ater infrastructure to a fast -growing population. In sub -Saharan Africa urban \\nareas, only 20% of the population has access to safely managed sanitati on and 25% to basic sanitation \\n(WHO/UNICEF, 2019[27]).

In addition, the limited solid waste management in most \\nAfrican cities is further aggravating the situation through dirty water runoffs . \\nThe ambient quality of water bodies is poorly monitored and only a few African countries are reporting on \\nSDG 6.3.2 (proportion of water bodies with good ambient water quality). This situation underlines that \\nwater quality data is either missing or not readily available.

In 2019, failed rains across Eastern Africa, Southern Africa \\nand the Horn of Africa increased food prices and drove up the aid needs of more than 45  million people \\nstruggling to find enough food across 14 countries. This same year, in Southern Africa alone, according to \\nthe International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescen t Societies (IFRC), at least 11  million people \\nfaced food shortages due to drought. Diminished and late rainfall, combined with long -term increases in \\ntemperatures, have jeopardised the food security and energy supplies in the region, most acutely in Zambia \\nand Zimbabwe. Grain production was down 30% across the region and 53% in Zimbabwe. Livestock \\nfarmers in Southern Africa have also suffered losses due to starvation and to early culling of herds forced \\nby shortages of water and feed. In Kenya, water scarcity induces rural to urban migration, thus increasing \\npressure on already insufficient urban water supplies  (Kinuthia-Njenga, 2009[48]). In Mombasa, Kenya, a \\ndrought caused an increase in food prices, disproportionately affecting the urban poor  (Awuor, Orindi and \\nAdwera, 2008[49]). In Lusaka, Zambia, following a drought year, urban agricultural output was significantly \\nreduced, thus undermining household food security and income  (Simatele, Binns and Simatele, 2012[50]). \\nThese examples highlight the various economic, social and health implications of droughts. They also \\nunderline the vulnerability of African cities to such water risks. \\nIn 2015, the city of Cape Town started experiencing drought and water reservoirs further reached critically \\nlow levels in 2017 and in 2018. The intense hydrological drought attributable to the effects of climate \\nchange was exacerbated by anthropic factors such as rising urb an population and regional competition \\namong local water users, all placing enormous stress on limited resources. The 16  April 2018 was \\npostulated to be the day that Cape Town switched off its taps. Colloquially termed “Day Zero”, this was \\ndefined as the p oint at which the dam levels fell to 13.5%, therefore requiring all taps in the city of Cape \\nTown to be shut off and citizens to fetch a daily 25 litres per person at public points of distribution (PODs). \\nAlthough Day Zero did not happen, the Cape Town wat er crisis exposed a serious vulnerability to water \\nscarcity issues for the city of Cape Town, the surrounding urban agglomerations and the country at large. \\nWater scarcity issues put greater pressure on the rural -urban interdependent relationship. The 2015 -18 \\ndrought had a significant impact on agriculture, livelihoods and communities, with an estimated economic \\nloss of ZAR 5.9 billion (USD 0.4 billion) for agriculture in the Western Cape alone, 30 000 job losses and \\n13%-20% exports drop (World Wildlife Fund, 2018 [51]). Tourism accounts for 10% of South Africa’s \\neconomic output and provides 1.5  million jobs – around 10% of t otal employment in the country (Parks, \\n2019[52]).'),\n",

The most significant of these are \\nconsidered megatrends, as they are large in scale and long -term in nature – usually relevant for at least \\ntwo decades. Consequently, megatrends usually refer to circumstances that will unfold across the globe \\nin a number of countries and that can often drive the global economy and society i n specific directions. \\nMegatrends are likely to result in meaningful, long -term changes impacting social, economic, political, \\nenvironmental and technological issues. Despite their potential for high impact, they often unfold slowly \\nand follow relatively stable trajectories. \\nIn African countries and cities, some of these megatrends significantly affect water security, as is the case \\nof climate change, urbanisation and population growth. Climate change is also exacerbating the pressure \\non water resources wit h two -thirds of African cities estimated at “extreme risk” with regard to climate \\nchange impacts. For instance, in sub -Saharan Africa, the cumulative effect of the last decades indicates \\nthat floods and droughts alone are responsible for around 80% of disa ster-related deaths and 70% of \\neconomic losses (Ndaruzaniye et al., 2010[7]). With 41% of the sub -Saharan African population currently \\nliving in cities, and a projected increase to 60% by 2050 (UN, 2015[5]), urbanisation will exacerbate existing \\nchallenges related to access to quality drinking water and sanitation services. And last but not least, \\ndemographic trends are pushing water demand up (Figure 1.4) with African urban population projected to \\nnearly double from more than 560 million in 2015 to 1.1 billion in 2050 (UN, 2014[44]). \\nFigure 1.4.

Projected t emperatures in Africa will rise \\nfaster than the global average throughout the 21 st century, thus reinforcing water scarcity and drought \\nrisks. Pressure on already limited water supply is expected to increase sharply due to changes in water \\ncycles caused by erratic rainfall and to affect negatively the production of annual crops such as cereals \\nand cotton, or perennial crops like coffee, cocoa and palm oil. This will lead to production shocks that will \\nworsen food insecurity. Livestock may also suffer from the shrinking water supply, as grazing land is \\ndivided and damaged. Researchers est imate that climate change and climate hazards ( Figure 1.5) will \\ndepress growth in global yields by 5% to 30% by 2050 (Porter et al., 2013[54]). \\nFigure 1.5.

Along with other African cities, \\nKinshasa remains at high risk with cumula ting factors of high poverty rates, expanding slums, weak \\ngovernance and limited capacity to adapt to climate change. Its increasing urban population which is \\nexpected to double by 2035, will very likely intensify the city ’s already alarming risk profile i n terms of \\naccess to drinking water or habitat. Among other cities most at risk of climate change are : Kampala, \\nUganda, where the annual population is set to grow by 5.1% a year on average between 2018-35; Dar-es-\\nSalaam in Tanzania (4.8%) ; Abuja (4.5%) and Lagos (3.5%) in Nigeria; Addis Ababa (4.3%) in Ethiopia; \\nand Luanda (3.7%) in Angola.  \\nUrbanisation \\nAfricapolis data highlight the staggering pace of the ongoing urbanisation transformation in Africa. \\nFifty percent of Africa’s population live in one of the continent’s 7 617 urban agglomerations. In 9 countries, \\nthe level of urbanisation is above 66% and a further 30 countries have an intermediary level of urbanisation \\nbetween 33% and 65%. In 1950, only 4 countries had a level of urbanisation above 33%, while 35 countries \\nwere below 10%. North Africa is the continent’s most urbanised region (78%), and Egypt and Libya the \\n2 countries with the highest levels of urbanisation with 93% and 81% respectively ( Figure 1.6). The other \\n2 countries with a level of urbanisation above 80% are Gabon (81%) and S ão Tomé and Príncipe (80%). \\nThe countries with the lowest levels are Niger (17%), Burundi (21%), Eritrea (24%), Lesotho (26%) and \\nSouth Sudan (27%). \\nOverall, countries with higher income levels in the African continent tend to have higher urbanisation levels. \\nThe only two low -income countries (gross national income per capita) with a le vel of urbanisation above \\n50% are Rwanda, with the highest population density, and Gambia, one of the smallest land areas. \\nSimilarly, the countries with the highest levels of urbanisation, Djibouti, Egypt, Gabon and Libya, are all \\nmiddle-income countries and countries whose land areas are almost entirely desertic or with large forest \\nareas, like Gabon. In these countries, the share of the agricultural population – the main activity of the rural \\npopulation – is rather low. \\nUrbanisation dynamics are influence d by a variety of structural and socio -economic factors, such as \\ngeography and climate, population growth, size and density, income levels and economic structure, \\npolicies and institutions and cyclical factors such as environmental disasters, conflict and economic cycles. \\nThese factors are not of equal importance and vary over time depending on country contexts and \\ninterrelations. Since the 1990s , the major driver of urbanisation has been high population growth which \\ncontributes directly to the natural increase of urban populations. \\nThis urban population growth in Africa is mostly absorbed by the outward expansion of metropolitan areas \\nand secondary cities. As such, African cities are sprawling extensively, which exacerbates the spatial \\nconcentration of economic, environmental and social problems  (World Resources Institute, 2019 [47]) and \\nholds significant implications for water supply and demand. Between now and 2050, two thirds of the \\nurbanisation will happen in towns and intermed iary cities (AfDB/OECD/UNDP, 2016[56]), which have less \\ncapacities to deploy infrastructure than larger cities. Because of this urban expansion pattern, African cities \\nsuffer from a lack of adequate formal housing and access to basic local public services, both in the informal \\nsettlements of the urban centre but also in the periphery. Indeed, densely populated informal settlements \\nlack proper urban infrastructure. In most African cities, population and economic density is higher near the \\ncity centre and falls by 7% one kilometre away from the city centre, compared to 4% on average in other \\ncities around the world. Night light intensity also falls by 15%, compared with 11% in cities elsewhere  \\n(Vinay, 2017[29]). This development pattern already poses many challenges in terms of planning, housing \\nand basic infrastructure , and public services provision, among others. This is reflected in the \\nheterogeneous development of planned and unplanned urban areas , the latter comprising informal'),\n",

In some cases, however, both public and private longer-term investments may have been delayed \\nor cancelled due to loss of public revenue and the economic situation.  \\nIn South Africa, while COVID-19 has hit the Western Cape P rovince particularly hard with 270 691 cases \\nand 10 731 deaths (20% of total deaths in South Africa), located essentially in the city of Cape Town, the \\ncity administration has shown remarkable resilience in dealing with the pandemic, drawing extensively on  \\nlessons from past crises such as droughts (Box 1.4). \\n14\\n22\\n27\\n41\\n51\\n27\\n24\\n31\\n30\\n39\\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\\nSierra Leone\\nSenegal\\nGuinea\\nNigeria\\nCote d'Ivoire\\n%\\nFixed facility Mobile facility\"),\n",

How Cape Town Water Crisis paved the way for COVID-19 crisis management \\nCovid-19 impacts on South Africa and Cape Town \\nLike most other countries around the globe, South Africa has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, \\nwith over 1 485 000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and over 47 400 deaths (as of February 2021) (WHO, \\n2021[68]). Though the impact of the pandemic has been relatively mitigated on the African continent in \\nrelation to other regions, South Africa has the continent’s highest caseload as of March 2021  and \\ncontinues to bear the hig hest burden of the pandemic, with 69% of total deaths (as of January 2021) \\nand 57% of all reported and confirmed cases in the African region  (WHO, 2021[69]). In addition to human \\ncasualties, the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown have triggered a sharp drop in economic \\nactivity. \\nSouth Africa reacted quickly to the outbreak by establishing a nationwide lockdown on 26 March 2020. \\nEconomic activity was reduced in mining and industry, and stopped in the tourism, entertainmen t and \\npassenger transport sectors. The OECD  (2020[70]) estimates that in a double -hit scenario, a new \\noutbreak affecting South Africa and its trading partner countries will curtail exports, deepening the \\nrecession to -8.2% in 2020 and limiting the recovery in 2021, with GDP growth at 0.6%.  \\nThe Western Cape has been one of the hardest -hit provinces in the country, with over 10 000 deaths \\nand over 270 000 cases  (Western Cape Government, 2020 [71]). The Cape Town metropolitan area \\naccounted for around 70% of total cases in the province . In terms of water management and service \\nprovision, the pandemic has emphasi sed the already existing inequalities in access to water and \\nsanitation services in townships, informal settlements and among the homeless in Cape Town. The \\nnational Department o f Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation procured 41 000 water tanks for \\nnational distribution to ensure water supply during the lockdown so that people in these living conditions \\ncan still have enough drinking water and maintain adequate and healthy hygi ene routines. However, \\nthere are very significant concerns about the spread of COVID -19 in informal settlements through \\ncommunal toilets and taps, as well as security concerns around the use of water tanks  (Hara, Ncube \\nand Sibanda, 2020[72]).  \\nCOVID-19 poses many challenges to the water sector encompassing economic and social issues. A \\nsustainable funding model for water and sanitation is needed but under so many stressed conditions \\nand with tariffs set below cost-recovery level, it will be challenging to finance all of the necessary water \\ninvestments to achieve resilience while addressing basic human and social needs. The National Water \\nand Sanitation Plan, which sets outs the country’s approach to address, among other issues, \\ninequalities in access to water and sanitation for the poor in cities, will be tested through the pandemic, \\nespecially with regards to the co-ordination between funding capacity and funding needs, in light of the \\nadded pressure that the pandemic entails in terms of resources.  \\nFrom crisis management to the “new normal” \\nLessons learned during the critical stages of Cape Town’s 2017 -18 water crisis have helped the city \\ncope with the hardships imposed by the pandemic in 2019-20.  \\nIn fact, terminology which has be come used globally such as the “new normal”, which makes a \\nreference to the realisation that the crisis brought on by the pandemic will bring about permanent \\nchange, was already used by stakeholders in the Western Cape to reference the effects of the drought \\nand the predicted impacts of climate change. Like the drought, the pandemic has precipitated changes \\nthat had profound economic impacts, with direct losses in earnings at many levels experienced by \\nindividuals, as well as countries’ GDP and growth rates . In addition, social changes in the way people'),\n",

Furthermore, the environmental aspect of both crises is \\nundeniable, with the longer-term impacts of climate change becoming more and more visible.  \\nSome important lesson s learned during the drought shaped the city’s response to COVID-19. For \\nexample, both crises led the Western Cape Government and Cape Town to value the importance of \\neffective communication with citizens and stakeholders for co -ordinated action and trust-building. This \\nneed for collaborative and open interactions between stakeholders has also become apparent during \\nthe COVID -19 crisis, where, despite the difficult conditions, municipal stakeholders have worked \\ntogether through transversal committees to minimise the impact of COVID-19 on its residents in a more \\ncohesive way, a method that was put into practice with the water crisis.  \\nCOVID-19 may provide the impulse necessary towards a green recovery, building off the 2019 Cape \\nTown Resilience Strategy implemented as a response to the water crisis. For example, the impulse to \\nprioritise investment in ecosystem services such as the clearing of alien invasive species as a more \\ncost-effective way to augment water supply may become stronger now, in times of fundi ng limitations \\nbrought about by the pandemic. However, the full impact of COVID-19 is yet to be seen and the future \\nremains uncertain as long as the pandemic remains rampant. \\nSource: Author’s elaboration based on Hara, M., B. Ncube and D.

Thirty-four African countries (in a sample of 44) have set such schemes for water supply but \\nonly half of them are reported to be widely used, while another 7 countries hav e not established any \\naffordability scheme. \\nIn addition to social tariffs or connection fees, cities have implemented other explicit measures at the local \\nlevel to guarantee access to water and/or sanitation services to vulnerable groups.

Water access and gender inequality \\nIn urban areas of Africa, more than half the urban population is forced to use a collective water source, \\nusually a standpipe, a pump or, less frequently, a well  (WHO/UNICEF, 2015[4]). This requires a large \\namount of time to travel to the water collecti on point, wait at the water source, transport the water and \\nstore it. Aligned with socially -constructed gender roles, the burden of water collection and storage \\nusually falls on women and girls. In sub -Saharan Africa, it is estimated that women and girls s pend \\nabout 40 billion hours per year transporting water  (UNDP, 2006[5]). For example, a study conducted in \\nthe informal settlements of Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso shows that females are responsible for water \\ncollection in 84% o f households sampled  (Dos Santos S, 2016 [6]). This study showed that male \\nhousehold water collectors often use standpipes while female collectors preferred boreholes, despite \\nthe latter requir ing significant physical effort . Women’s preference for this type of supply is explained \\nboth by economic factors (water at boreholes is cheaper than water at standpipes) and by distance: \\nwomen, who are less likely to have motorised transport than men, prefer boreholes that are often less \\nremote from the dwellings than the standpipes located in the formal zones. More studies are needed to \\nsystematically document household gender -water relations in informal settlements and how this may \\nreinforce inequalities in water access. \\nSource: Santos, S. et al. (2017[7]), “Urban growth and water access in sub -Saharan Africa: Progress, challenges and emerging research \\ndirections”, Science of the Total Environment, Vol. 607-608, Elsevier, pp. 497-508. \\nAt the local level, gender -sensitive approaches that involve women at design, implementation and \\nmanagement phases are proving successful to improve the suitability, sustainability and reach of water \\nand sanitation services. Embedding further gender equity into p olicies at all levels will be crucial to \\nachieving many parts of the UN Sustainable Development Goal ( SDG) agenda. One illustrative case is \\nthat of the Obudu Plateau in Nigeria, where the construction of a tourist resort exacerbated existing \\npressures and tensions around water resources  (Majekodunmi, 2006 [8]). As a result, the Nigerian \\nConservation Foundation implemented a Watershed Management Project in 1999. Women were included \\nthroughout all stages, including the design, impl ementation and monitoring of the project, and elected to \\nthe management committee. This allowed the resolution of a water conflict between the Becheve women \\nand the Fulani herdsmen, and reduced diarrhoea cases by 45%. The considerable reduction in the time  \\nneeded to collect water also gave women more time for income -generating activities such as farming as \\nwell as other activities, in addition to increasing the rate of school attendance for girls. The World Bank \\nRural Water Supply and Sanitation Project, ca rried out in 6 Moroccan provinces, reduced the time spent \\nby women and girls collecting water by between 50% and 90%  (World Bank, 2003 [9]). As a result, the \\nschool attendance of girls in these provinces increased by 20% in 4 years. \\nInstitutions in charge of water at the national and local levels in Africa \\nWater and sanitation provision responsibility commonly centralised at the national level \\nin Africa \\nIn a majority of African countries, water policy is driven at the national lev el by a line  ministry. A large \\nnumber of African countries have also set up national water service providers, thus amplifying further the \\nleadership of the national level over water policies ( Figure 2.5). As an illustration, in 71% of the countries \\nwhere respondent cities from the OECD survey sample are located, the national level is responsible for \\nthe provision of water supply and sanitation (WSS) services throughout the country’s territory (Table 2.2).'),\n",

This includes the ability to adapt service quality standards to local needs and the \\nspecific context of disfavoured neighbourhoods and vu lnerable urban areas. Initiatives such as flow \\nlimiters, the use of plastic-bodied water meters, ground tanks and semi-pressure water service levels, were \\nfirst introduced to South Africa by the water service of eThekwini (Box 2.3) in order to provide water supply \\nin informal settlements. At the same time, this diversity of access forms generates some co-ordination and \\nregulation challenges. For instance, in Cape Town during the water crisis, many residents and businesses \\ndeveloped alternative water supplies including drilling private boreholes, in response to the severe water \\nrestrictions and penalty tariffs for high volume consumers decided by the city. The legal status of these \\nboreholes was poorly defined (guidelines were issued in 2018 by the National Department for Water and \\nSanitation) and they have led to over -abstraction, illegal resale of water, inadequate water quality \\ncompliance and difficulties to get people to register their boreholes through the online registry. Unregulated \\nboreholes are likely to pose a long -term threat to the recharge and sustainability of underground water \\nbodies, as well as quality issues due to possible contaminated aquifers in the absence of protected areas. \\nMoreover, the unregulated use of groundwater is competing with legal use granted through water licences. \\nBox 2.3. Adapting quality standards in eThekwini, South Africa \\nIn eThekwini , South A frica, Durban Metro Water Services experimented with alternative service \\nstandards in order to meet the needs of customers in poor areas. Varying quality standards were \\nproposed to customers so that they could choose between a range of options with differe ntiated \\nprice/quality characteristics. For example, eThekwini Metro Water Services developed semi -\\npressurised water systems with the provision of a roof tank as an alternative to a full pressurised system \\n(which may be unaffordable). In such a system, water is reticulated using small diameter piping, which \\nis laid along the major access routes or tracks located within the informal area. At appropriate intervals, \\nconnections are made to this reticulation and a manifold, which allows approximately 20 houses t o \\nconnect to the water main, is installed.

The \\nprinciples acknowledge that good governance is a means to an end to master complexity and managing \\ntrade-offs in a policy domain that is highly sensitive to fragmentation, silos, scale mismatch, negative \\nexternalities, monopolies and large capital-intensive investment. They consider that governance is good if \\nit can help to solve key water challenges, using a combination of bottom-up and top-down processes while \\nfostering constructive state-society relations. It is bad if it generates undue transaction costs and does not \\nrespond to place-based needs.

In the absence of integrated basin governance systems, such a mis match between \\nhydrological and administrative boundaries can have consequences in terms of competition over water \\nuses and effectiveness of service delivery. In order to address water governance properly, there is a need \\nto consider the territorial continuity as the basin scale links upstream and downstream communities. In the \\ncase of water, beyond the functional and institutional/administrative perspectives, the watershed, which \\nfollows hydrological logics, must be considered.  \\nIntegrated water resource ma nagement (IWRM) is “a process, which promotes the co -ordinated \\ndevelopment and management of water, land and related resources, in order to maximise the resultant \\neconomic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of  vital \\necosystems” (Global Water Partnership, 2000 [2]). By bringing together stakeholders from various sectors \\nand across levels of government, IWRM promotes the co -ordinated development and management of \\nwater, thus providing a holistic framework for addressing water -related challenges. At their core, IWRM \\nframeworks ensure that water resources are developed, managed and used in an equitable, sustainable \\nand efficient manner.  \\nOECD Water Governance Principle n°2 on Appropriate Scale(s) \\nManage water at the appropriate scale(s) within integrated basin governance systems to reflect local \\nconditions and foster co -ordination between the different scales. To that effect, water management \\npractices and tools should: \\n1. Respond to long-term environmental, economic and social objectives with a view to making the \\nbest use of water resources, through risk prevention and IWRM. \\n2. Encourage sound hydrological cycle management from capture and distribution of freshwater \\nto the release of wastewater and return flows. \\n3. Promote adaptive and mitigation strategies, action program mes and measures based on clear \\nand coherent mandates, through effective basin management plans that are consistent with \\nnational policies and local conditions. \\n4. Promote multi-level co-operation among users, stakeholders and levels of government for the \\nmanagement of water resources. \\n5. Enhance riparian co-operation on the use of transboundary freshwater resources. \\nSource: OECD (2015[1]), OECD Principles on Water Governance , https://www.oecd.org/gov/regional-policy/OECD-Principles-on-Water-\\nGovernancebrochure.pdf. \\nThe reporting of United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goal ( SDG) 6.5.1 on “implementation of \\nintegrated water resources management” shows that 42  African countries (82%) have adopted IWRM \\nbased policies, laws and plans at the national level, thus establishing an enabling environment to support \\nIWRM implementation.

The alteration of landscape affects water resources \\navailability, quality and quantity. Ecosystems functions are heavily impaired when land use is modified. For \\nexample, where previously forested slopes retained soil sediment and moisture, conversion to agriculture \\nmay reduce dry season stream flows and generate higher sediment runoff, soil erosion or diffuse pollution. \\nSub-Saharan Africa is the region that has lost the largest share of its forest land (12%) over the past \\n25 years. \\nConversion of land into built and urbanised areas is also affecting water availability, quantity and quality. \\nBuildings, roads, roofs, paved areas and other hard surfaces prevent rainfall from infiltrating into the soil, \\nthus exacerbating flooding risks. Urban catchments in African cities often face significant land development \\npressures for agriculture or urban settlements ( Figure 3.5). Water security can be at risk when cities are \\nrelying exclusively on surface water sources for their water supply, like in  Cape Town, South Africa, for \\ninstance.

In Eastern Africa, the conversion of natural \\nlandscapes into cropland and livestock grazing resulted in soil modification affecting native plant species, \\nwhich induced a reduction in the number and diversity of wildlife (The Nature Conservancy, 2016 [7]). The \\nunplanned urbanisation of African cities is also impeding further the development and implementation of \\ncoherent environmental and ecosystem conservation policies that could reduce water risks. \\nAcknowledging the influence of land use policy upon urban water policy, some cities set up tools to ensure \\nbetter cross-sectoral policy coherence at the local level ( Box 3.3). Nevertheless, most African cities are \\noften struggling with overlapping and contradictory property systems, in which rights are often unclear and \\nadministrative systems function poorly. In Western Africa, for example , only 2%-3% of land is held with a \\ngovernment registered title. In several cases, the lack of coherence across sectoral policies has impeded \\nthe implementation of social measures to promote water access. In Abidjan , Côte d’Ivoire, for instance, a \\n75% subsidy was offered to low -income households for their first piped connection to the formal water \\nsupply. However, households had to provide proof of legal settlement; hence, the poor living in unplanned \\nurban areas were usually not eligible for the subsidy (Ainuson, 2010[8]). In addition, across the continent, \\nplanning regulations are often anachronistic, restrictive and impracticable from an enforcement point of \\nview (Lall, Henderson and Venables, 2017[9]).  \\nBox 3.3.

Contaminated water and poor sanitation are linked to the \\ntransmission of diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis  A, typhoid and polio. \\nMicrobiological contamination of groundwater and water -related diseases challenging for sub -Saharan \\nAfrica with low -income groups and children be ing disproportionately affected  (Howard G, 2006 [11]). The \\nlack of access to clean water, sanitation and handwashing facilities is a leading to the death of some \\n842 000 people each year from diarrhoea, including 361  000 children aged under 5 each year  (WHO \\nAfrica, 2021[12]). Faecal waste is the largest source of contamination in urban groundwater, in particular \\nwhere there is high-density housing with poor and/or inadequate sanitation facilities and treatment. Water \\ncuts and shortages in African cities also require households to switch temporarily from their principal water \\nsupply source to an alternative one, whether improved or not. This potentially generates varying social and \\nhealth impacts on users, depending on the context  (Santos et  al., 2017 [13]).

With collection rates below \\n50% in many African cities (Table 3.1), unmanaged urban waste is increasing water risks. Indeed, this low \\nlevel of service and the common lack of guidelines for the management of sanitary landfills are affecting \\nwater quality, generating runoff pollution into rivers and coastal waters. The lack of waste management \\nalso leads to blocked waterways which exacerbate flood and health risks (Lall, Henderson and Venables, \\n2017[9]). The situation is especially problematic in informal settlements where garbage piles up along \\nwalkways and roads, and in gutters, drains and waterways. \\nTable 3.1.

Continuous monitoring of water systems and processes \\ntherefore appears crucial. As stated by the UN, “Data is  the lifeblood of decision -making and the raw \\nmaterial for accountability. Quality and timely data are vital for enabling governments, international \\norganisations, civil society, the private sector and the general public to make informed decisions and to \\nensure the accountability of representative bodies”  (n.d.[15]). Data and data -related analytics make it \\npossible to understand complex water systems from a holistic perspective. Nevertheless, an increasing \\nnumber of institutions face a widening gap between emerging realities (like growing populations, climate \\nchange and rapid digitalisation) and their existing practices and capacities.  \\nThe GLAAS report 2019 provides information with regard to monitoring and evaluation practices of SDG 6 \\nin African countries. In 34% of African countries (15 countries), regulatory authorities do not release publicly \\naccessible reports on drinking water quality. The proportion reduces to 16% of countries (7 countries) for \\nreports on treated wastewat er flows and faecal sludge volumes ( Figure 3.6).

In sub-Saharan urban areas, \\nthis proportion reaches 50% for water and 20% for sanitation. Hence considerable investment efforts are \\nstill required to achieve SDG 6.1.1 and 6.2.1 targets by 2030. Furthermore, among the 25 African countries \\nreporting in the GLAAS report 2019 (UN-Water, 2019[17]) on national systems to support drinking  water, \\nsanitation and hygiene, 20 declared that the financing allocated to sanitation improvements correspond to \\nless than 50% of what is actually needed to meet national targets. \\nThe OECD Council (OECD, 2016[22]) recommends setting up measures for the sustainable financing of \\nwater services, water infrastructures, water resources management and protection of water -related \\necosystems by: \\n1. Considering the following four principles for financing water resources management: “polluter \\npays”, “beneficiary pays”, equity and coherence between policies that affect water resources. \\n2. Aiming for the greatest social returns to investment, for example through:  \\no Exploring options that can minimise current or future financing needs while addressing \\ntrade-offs and exploiting synergies between policy objectives and between short - and long-\\nterm challenges. \\no Taking stock of existing assets, maintaining them, looking for efficiency gains. \\no Developing strategic financial plans that match financial resources with p olicy objectives and \\nensuring affordability for vulnerable segments of society, including through ad hoc targeted \\nmeasures. \\no Setting up an independent review of the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of investments. \\n3. Considering diversifying revenue streams a nd tapping into new sources of capital, where needed \\nand in line with policy objectives. A first step could be to combine revenues from water tariffs, \\ntransfers from public budgets and transfers from the international community to recover the costs \\nof investment, operation and maintenance of water infrastructure as much as possible and where \\nefficient. \\nOECD Water Governance Principle n°6 on the Governance-\\nfinancing Nexus  \\nEnsure that governance arrangements help mobilise water finance and allocate financial  resources in \\nan efficient, transparent and timely manner, through: \\n1. Promoting governance arrangements that help water institutions across levels of government \\nraise the necessary revenues to meet their mandates, building through principles such as the \\n“polluter pays” and “user pays” principles, for example, as well as payment for environmental \\nservices. \\n2. Carrying out sector reviews and strategic financial planning to assess short-, medium- and long-\\nterm investment and operational needs and take measures to help ensure availability and \\nsustainability of such finance. \\n3.

As a result, 79% of the surveyed cities state that they do not make \\ndecisions over water tariff setting as there is uniform national guidance. This is, for instance, the case in \\nMorocco where a ministerial decision is providing the specifications for water tariff setting or in Ghana \\nwhere the Public Utility Regulatory Commission is setting the tariff policy. \\nSome countries, like Côte d’Ivoire, as part of their centralised tariff setting p olicy, have established the \\noperating cost recovery principle as a rule for urban WSS. Operating costs of urban WSS must be covered \\nby revenues from the water sales without resorting to resources from the central state budget. In addition, \\ntwo earmarked fu nds financed via the water invoice  have been set up, namely the National Water Fund \\nand the Development Fund . The former ensures the repayment of loans contracted for the benefit of the \\nwater supply and sanitation sector while the latter finances social connections, works to renew installations, \\nworks to strengthen and extend the network, and invests in works. \\nWater abstraction and pollution charges are another economic instrument that can help manage resources \\nthrough partially reflecting some of the costs  associated with using or polluting it. These charges can be \\nused to fund the costs of managing water resources and regulating activities that impact water availability \\nand quality.

However, this \\ntask requires an important capacity to produce, update and share consistent and comparable data and \\ninformation on the state of enviro nment and resources, and to carry out technical and socio -economic \\nassessments. \\nWhile pollution and abstraction charges are often driven by national regulatory and policy frameworks, \\nthere are not common in all African countries and cities. Abstraction charges are being collected in 58% of \\nthe cities surveyed, whereas pollution charge s are less developed (3 6%) ( Table 3.7). Reasons for the \\nslower uptake of pollution charges in the management of water pollution may include: political resistance \\nfrom polluters; limited data on the costs of environmental degradation; difficulties in measuring sources of \\npollution and attributing them to polluters. \\nTable 3.7.

They can initiate and support it, but they can also oppose efforts, attempt to block them or divert \\nthem to serve their own aims. Stakeholder engagement provides opportunities to share objectives, \\nexperiences and responsibilities, and to secure more support to the solutions that will be reached while \\nvoicing and addressing concerns and interests. As such, stakeholder engagement is a means for groups \\nand individuals to share tasks and responsibilities in a sector where they often contribute to challenges as \\nwell as solutions.  \\nOECD Water Governance Principle n°10 on Stakeholder \\nEngagement \\nPromote stakeholder engagement for informed and outcome -oriented contributions to water policy \\ndesign and implementation, through:  \\n1. Mapping public, private and non-profit actors who have a stake in the outcome or who are likely \\nto be affected by water-related decisions, as well as their responsibilities, core motivations and \\ninteractions. \\n2. Paying special attention to under-represented categories (youth, the poor, women, Indigenous \\npeoples, domestic users) , newcomers (property developers, institutional investors) and other \\nwater-related stakeholders and institutions. \\n3. Defining the line of decision-making and the expected use of stakeholders’ inputs, and mitigating \\npower imbalances and risks of consultation capture from over -represented or overly vocal \\ncategories, as well as between expert and non-expert voices. \\n4. Encouraging capacity development of relevant stakeholders as well as accurate, timely and \\nreliable information, as appropriate. \\n5. Assessing the process and outcomes of stakeholder engagement to learn, adjust and improve \\naccordingly, including the evaluation of costs and benefits of engagement processes . \\n6. Promoting legal and institutional frameworks, or ganisational structures and responsible \\nauthorities that are conducive to stakeholder engagement, taking account of local \\ncircumstances, needs and capacities. \\n7.

The lack of funding, time and staff along with the complexity of the issues at hand or the low \\ncapacity of stakeholders to engage in consultat ion processes represent some of these impediments. The \\npolitical discontinuity and the weak legal framework to support engagement are also reported as significant \\nissues ( Figure 3.17). In such a context, cities believe that improving knowledge, information and \\ncompetency will be key to strengthen stakeholder engagement and citizen awareness on water -related \\ntopics in the future. For instance, in August 201 7, the city of C ape Town established a Water Resilience \\nAdvisory Committee (WRAC) as a response to the drought crisis in order to gather a variety of stakeholders \\noutside the municipal administration and foster information and knowledge. In its 2019 Water Strategy (City \\nof Cape Town, 2019 [34]), Cape Town capitalised on this experience to further create a Collaborative \\nResilience Action Plan - a multi-stakeholder platform to co -ordinate efforts and improve governance and \\ndecision-making during any crisis. \\nFigure 3.17. Main obstacles to stakeholder engagement in surveyed African cities \\n \\nNote: 32 cities responded to the question “Which obstacles mostly hinder stakeholder engagement in your city?”. \\nSource: OECD (2021[6]), OECD Survey on Water Governance in African Cities, OECD, Paris. \\nIn addition to the above -mentioned obstacles, African cities also declare that some categories of \\nstakeholders are more difficult to engage with than others. Service providers (28%) and central government \\n(28%) are reported as the most difficult counterparts to engage with, followed by vulnerable groups (19%). \\nIn response, 42% of cities have implemented specific mechanisms for poor populations and population \\nliving in informal settlements. For instance, in Accra, the Ghana Water Company Limited established a \\nunique Low-Income Customer Support Unit (LICSU) to exclusively deal with unserved areas in the country. \\nThe LICSU ensures that newly developed and unserved urban settlements are piped and connected to \\nthe network. This unit provides affordable and sustainable solutions to increase access to safely managed \\ndrinking water for the urban poor. In 2019, the unit successfully managed to connect almost 10  000 low-\\nincome households to piped water supply. \\nBesides the difficulties encountered to engage with stakeholders, African cities are primarily lacking basic \\nknowledge about the stakeholders they should engage with. More than three surveyed cities out of four \\nhave not carried out a stakeholder mapping for their water sector ( Figure 3.18). Such mapping allows to \\nclearly identify public, private and non-profit actors that have a stake in the outcome or that are likely to be \\naffected by water-related decisions, as well as their responsibilities, core motivations and interactions. This \\nmapping can be considered as a first step to guide and build stakeholder engagement processes.  \\n0\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n%'),\n",

Stakeholder engagement mechanisms used by surveyed African cities \\n \\nNote: 24 cities responded to the question  “Which mechanisms does your city mostly use to engage stakeholders in water -related decision-\\nmaking?”. \\nSource: OECD (2021[6]), OECD Survey on Water Governance in African Cities, OECD, Paris. \\nIn a tentative taxonomy, the OECD (2015[39]) describes some of the advantages and drawbacks that both \\nformal and informal engagement mechanisms bring about.  \\n\\uf0b7 Formal mechanisms such as water associations and river basin organisations are often based on \\nthe principle of representative democracy, which confers them legitimacy. However, they can also \\nbe perceived as single-minded when they focus solely on pushing forward the agenda of a single \\ngroup of stakeholders. River basin organisations can present challenges in terms of lobbying and \\nconsultation capture when discussions and decisions are “highjacked” or monopolised by the \\ninterests of certain groups. It can also generate principle-agent tensions by which the person sitting \\nat the table voices his/her own concern rather than representing his/her broader constituency. This \\nshould be a key concern when selecting stakeholders to participate in advisory boards, wor king \\ngroups or assemblies.  \\n\\uf0b7 The relatively informal nature of meetings and workshops can foster both deliberation and build a \\nsense of community. They provide an open atmosphere which makes participants generally more \\nwilling to discuss issues and maximise s dialogues on issues that may not come to light through \\nmore structured mechanisms. For instance, meetings and workshops are flexible in terms of \\ntimeframe and scale (from community meetings to international conferences) and can apply to a \\nwide range of issues (e.g. from discussing a municipal sewer project to debating on transboundary \\nbasin management agreements). They offer an opportunity for anyone to express concerns, \\naccess and share information, and gain a better understanding. However, if tools used  to involve \\nstakeholders do not have a minimal level of structure and mediation, outcomes may be difficult to \\nincorporate into final decisions. Follow -up is also needed to turn views and concerns into actual \\ncontributions to decision-making beyond information sharing. \\nCritical aspects of governance should guide stakeholder engagement frameworks. Fair and equitable \\naccess to engagement opportunities is key to ensure a balanced and representative process that takes \\ninto account diverse ideas and opinions. Bei ng transparent and open about the ways to identify \\nstakeholders, choose engagement mechanisms and define the objectives pursued can help to raise \\ninterest among stakeholders and develop an understanding of and support for the final decisions.

According to the 2023 Africa Sustainable Development Report, 411 \\nmillion Africans still lack access to safe water, and almost three-fourths don’t \\nbenefit from safely managed sanitation services (United Nations \\nDevelopment Programme, 2023). \\nThe urgency of ensuring water security is heightened by the effects of \\nclimate change, including prolonged droughts that threaten agriculture as well as household \\nwater supplies (Mumssen, 2022; Malpass & Sall, 2022). \\nThe latest Afrobarometer surveys in 39 African countries find little progress toward the goal of \\nuniversal access to safe water and sanitation. Water supply ranks fourth among the most \\nimportant problems that Africans want their government to address. About one in four \\ncitizens report that their household frequently went without enough clean water during the \\npast year. Only minorities enjoy access to piped water and a sanitation system, with stark \\ndisadvantages among rural and poor populations. A growing majority give their government \\npoor marks on their provision of water and sanitation services. \\nAfrobarometer surveys \\nAfrobarometer is a pan-African, non-partisan survey research network that provides reliable \\ndata on African experiences and evaluations of democracy, governance, and quality of life. \\nNine survey rounds in up to 42 countries have been completed since 1999. Round 9 surveys \\n(2021/2023) cover 39 countries. (See Appendix Table A.1 for a list of countries and fieldwork \\ndates.) \\nAfrobarometer’s national partners conduct face-to-face interviews in the language of the \\nrespondent’s choice that yield country-level results with margins of error of +/-2 to +/-3 \\npercentage points at a 95% confidence level. \\nThis 39-country analysis is based on 53,444 interviews. The data are weighted to ensure \\nnationally representative samples. When reporting multi-country averages, all countries are \\nweighted equally (rather than in proportion to population size).'),\n",
