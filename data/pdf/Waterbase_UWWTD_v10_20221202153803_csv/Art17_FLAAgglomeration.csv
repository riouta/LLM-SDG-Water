Relativamente all'art. 4  è previsto un progetto di opere fognarie atte a collettare le utenze comunali presso il depuratore ASI, già realizzato ma non ancora avviato e che avrà necessità di sostegni esterni per risolvere la problematica dell'avvio, detto intervento per i quali si sta formalizzando  una sinergia tra ATO5_Acea Ato 5 SpA, Comune di Anagni, AeA gestore del Consorzio industriale di Frosinone e Regione, per garantire l'intera copertura di smaltimento delle acque reflue dell'intero territorio comunale.
Nelle more della definizione del dossier “depuratore ASI”, il gestore del S.I.I., Acea Ato 5 SpA, ha realizzato studi e progettazioni alternative, attualmente in fase di autorizzazione, che prevedono anch'esse, attraverso interventi sui depuratori in esercizio, un percorso di riqualifica degli impianti esistenti di Ponte Piano e San Bartolomeo. Il progetto del depuratore “Ponte Piano”, si svilupperà in due stralci funzionali, un primo con un costo di intervento pari a € 3.402.349,91 tutto a carico del SII atto a soddisfare un carico influente di 6000 abitanti e un secondo lotto atto ad potenziare la capacità ricettiva fino a più di 9000 abitanti così da coprire tutto il carico influente. Il secondo progetto per l’adeguamento dell’impianto di depurazione “San Bartolomeo” con importo pari a 450.000 €, anch’esso a completo carico del SII prevede di  adeguare il trattamento dell'intero bacino della medesima località e conservare una riserva di trattamento per futuri incrementi della popolazione. Gli importi per i due interventi di cui sopra sono in quota parte previsti nel Piano degli Interventi per il biennio 2018-2019. La fase autorizzativa in corso prevede la necessità di regolarizzare a livello urbanistico l’area dell’impianto di depurazione Ponte Piano e vede interessati gli enti  Provincia di Frosinone e Comune di Anagni . Per il depuratore San Bartolomeo dopo che il Comune di Anagni ha reso disponibile l’area per la costruzione del nuovo impianto, si è ancora in attesa che lo stesso completi le procedure patrimoniali per la realizzazione dello scarico verso il più vicino fosso demaniale e che gli Uffici della Provincia di Frosinone rilascino la concessione idraulica. E’ possibile asserire che, pur nel caso vi sia la chiusura dell’iter autorizzativo con esito positivo per entrambi gli impianti entro la fine del 2022, considerando il necessario iter di aggiudicazione, la successiva fase di progettazione esecutiva e la costruzione, salvo imprevisti e/o posticipo delle autorizzazioni oltre il 2019, la data prevista per la riqualifica degli impianti di """"Ponte Piano - Primo Lotto"""" e """"San Bartolomeo""""   è prevedibile entro il primo semestre 2022.  Mentre per il completamento del secondo lotto di """"Ponte Piano"""" si prevede il primo semestre 2023.

The start date of 30/06/2022 refers to an additional smaller network contract. 
The investments reflect both the large network upgrade and work to reduce inflow and infiltration. Both are required to bring the network into compliance.
